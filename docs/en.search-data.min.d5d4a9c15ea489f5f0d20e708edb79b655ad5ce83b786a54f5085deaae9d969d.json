I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \"2014-09-28\" title = \"creating a new theme\" +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \"2014-09-28\" title = \"creating a new theme\" +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions # There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins # Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page # The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File # When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent # Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter # The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown # Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files # Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template # A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template # A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template # A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site # Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site # Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template.

The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public/ directory?

If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme # Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton # Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

This is the file public/index.html. Hugo created a css/ directory. Hugo created a js/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages. That\u0026rsquo;s because it considers a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically. The Home Page # Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page.

It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/js $ The Theme Development Cycle # When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\nPurge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4. I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory # When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload.

There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage # The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created.

That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\nrange .Title end The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\"tag\":\"tags\", \"category\":\"categories\"} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e second first $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts # We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File # $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e {{ .Title }} {{ .Title }} {{ .Content }} :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\"tag\":\"tags\", \"category\":\"categories\"} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e first first my first post\n$ cat public/post/second/index.html \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e second second my second post\n$ Notice that the posts now have content.

Hugo lets \u0026ldquo;slug\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;URL\u0026rdquo; override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.\nSharing Templates # If you\u0026rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s because we didn\u0026rsquo;t put the title in the home page\u0026rsquo;s template (layouts/index.html). That\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let\u0026rsquo;s look at a different option.\nWe can put the common bits into a shared template that\u0026rsquo;s stored in the themes/zafta/layouts/partials/ directory.\nCreate the Header and Footer Partials # In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme\u0026rsquo;s presentation.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e {{ .Title }} :wq $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html :wq Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials # The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:\n{{ template \"theme/partials/header.html\" . }} versus\n{{ partial \"header.html\" . }} Both pass in the context.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }} posts {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \"post\"}} {{ .Title }} {{ end }} {{ end }} pages {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \"page\") (eq .Type \"about\") }} {{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }} {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the home page is now \u0026ldquo;your title here\u0026rdquo;, which comes from the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable in the config.toml file.\nUpdate the Default Single Template to Use the Partials # $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }} {{ .Title }} {{ .Content }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.\nAdd “Date Published” to Posts # It\u0026rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let\u0026rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named \u0026ldquo;date.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that\u0026rsquo;s the value we want to display.\nAdd “Date Published” to the Template # We\u0026rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:\n{{ .Date.Format \"Mon, Jan 2, 2006\" }} Posts use the default single template, so we\u0026rsquo;ll change that file.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }} {{ .Title }} {{ .Date.Format \"Mon, Jan 2, 2006\" }} {{ .Content }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There\u0026rsquo;s a problem, though. The \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page also has the date displayed.\nAs usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a section template.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.\n$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }} {{ .Title }} {{ .Content }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} :wq Now we\u0026rsquo;ll update the post\u0026rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo\u0026rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }} {{ .Title }} {{ .Date.Format \"Mon, Jan 2, 2006\" }} {{ .Content }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself # DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/","title":"Migrating from Jekyll","section":"Blog","content":" Move static content to static # Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output.

If, like me, you have _site mapped to a git submodule on the gh-pages branch, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to do one of two alternatives:\nChange your submodule to point to map gh-pages to public instead of _site (recommended).\ngit submodule deinit _site git rm _site git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git public Or, change the Hugo configuration to use _site instead of public.\n{ .. \u0026quot;publishdir\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;_site\u0026quot;, .. } Convert Jekyll templates to Hugo templates # That\u0026rsquo;s the bulk of the work right here.

By the Implicit Function Theorem, we want to solve for $(u,v,w)$ if the Jacobian of $D_{(u,v,w)} (F_1, F_2, F_3) ;$ is invertible at that point.\nWe then compute partial derivatives, and evaluate them at $\\bigl(0,0,0,0,0,-2\\bigr)$: $$ D_{(u,v,w)} (F_1, F_2, F_3)=\\begin{bmatrix} F_{1u} \u0026amp; F_{1v}\u0026amp;F_{1w} \\ F_{2u} \u0026amp; F_{2v}\u0026amp;F_{2w} \\ F_{3u} \u0026amp; F_{3v}\u0026amp;F_{3w} \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 2v \u0026amp; 0 \\ 2u \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\ 2u \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$ At that point, $u=0$ and $v=0$, the determinant of this $3\\times 3$ matrix is $$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix} ;=; 1 ;\\neq; 0. $$ So the matrix is invertible.

This means we cannot apply the IFT to conclude that $F$ is invertible near $(0,1)$; there is no diffeomorphic local inverse of $F$ around $(0,1)$.\nTherefore, we conclude that the map $F$ does not have a local inverse near $(0,1)$.\nProblem [7.4] 4.

Therefore, the matrix is invertible, so by the IFT we know that we can solve for $u$ and $v$ as functions of $x,y$ near $,(2,-1)$. Now we compute $u_x(2,-1)$. For $F_1=0$: $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2-y^2 -u^3 +v^2 +4) ;=;2x ;-;3u^2 u_x ;+;2v v_x ;=;0 $$ At $(x,y,u,v)=(2,-1,2,1)$, this is $4 -12u_x + 2v_x=0$.

We first substitute $x=0,y=0$ into $F$: $$F(0,0)=0^2+0+\\sin(0\\cdot 0)=0$$ Hence $(0,0)$ lies on the curve $F(x,y)=0$. We then compute the partial at $(0,0)$: $$\\begin{align} F_{y} =1 +\\cos!\\bigl(xy\\bigr)\\bigl(x\\bigr) \\Longrightarrow F_{y}(0,0) =1 +0 =1\\neq 0 \\end{align} $$ And $$ \\begin{align} F_{x} =2x +\\cos!\\bigl(xy\\bigr)\\bigl(y\\bigr)\n\\Longrightarrow F_{y}(0,0) = 2\\cdot 0 + 0 = 0 \\end{align} $$\nBecause $F_{y}(0,0)=1\\neq 0$, the Implicit Function Theorem ensures that there exists neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in which we can uniquely solve the equation for $y$ as a function of $x$. Therefore, there exists $y =f(x)$ for $(x,y)$ near $(0,0)$ for all $x$ in the neighborhood of $0$.\nHowever, on the other hand, since $F_{x}(0,0)=0$, Implicit FT does not apply, so the test is conclusive. This means the usual IFT statement fails to guarantee a local solution of the form $x=h(y)$.\nProblem [7.12] Show that the implicit function theorem implies the inverse function theorem.\n[!definition|*]\nLet $f\\colon A\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ be of class $C^1$. Suppose $x_0\\in A$ and\n$$ J_f(x_0);=;\\det\\bigl(Df(x_0)\\bigr);\\neq;0. $$ We want to show that, there exist neighborhoods $U$ of $x_0$ in $A$ and $V$ of $y_0=f(x_0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that\n(1) $f(U)=V$ and $f\\colon U\\to V$ has an inverse $f^{-1}:V\\to U$. (2) $f^{-1}$ is of class $C^1$. (3) $D f^{-1}(y)=\\bigl[D f(x)\\bigr]^{-1}$ for all $x\\in U$ with $y=f(x)$. Define a new function $$F\\colon \\mathbb{R}^n\\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n, \\quad F(x,y)=f(x)-y $$ with $x=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,\\dots,y_n)$. Then we know that $F$ is $C^1$ because $f$ is $C^1$ and subtraction is smooth. Note that $F(x_0,,f(x_0))= f(x_0)- f(x_0)=0$. We want to compute the Jacobian of $F$ w.r.t. $y$. So for each $i=1,\\dots,n$, the $i$th component of $F$ is $$F_i(x,y)=f_i(x)-y_i.$$ Since $f_i(x)$ does not depend on $y$, we have for each $j=1,\\dots,n$ $$\\frac{\\partial F_i}{\\partial y_j}(x,y)=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_j}\\bigl(f_i(x)-y_i\\bigr) =\\frac{\\partial f_i(x)}{\\partial y_j}-\\frac{\\partial y_i}{\\partial y_j} =0-\\delta_{ij} $$ where $\\delta_{ij}$ is $$\\delta_{ij}= \\begin{cases}1 \\quad i=j \\0 \\quad i\\neq j \\ \\end{cases} $$ Thus, the $(i,j)$-entry of the Jacobian is $$\\left[\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x,y)\\right]{ij}=-\\delta{ij} $$ In matrix form, we have: $$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x,y)=-I $$ where $I$ is the $n\\times n$ identity matrix. Since the determinant $\\det(-I)=(-1)^n\\neq 0$, we know that $D_y F(x,y)=-I$ is invertible everywhere. This satisfy the condition for Implicit FT. Hence, by the Implicit Function Theorem, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x_0\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and a neighborhood $V$ of $y_0=f(x_0)\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ s.t. $\\forall, y\\in V$, $\\exists! ,x\\in U$ satisfying: $$F(x,y)=0 ;;\\Longleftrightarrow;; f(x)-y=0 ;;\\Longleftrightarrow;; y=f(x) $$ and we have a map that is $C^1$ $$\\Phi:V ;\\to; U \\quad\\text{such that}\\quad F\\bigl(\\Phi(y),,y\\bigr)=0 \\quad\\text{for all }y\\in V $$ which this demonstrates (2). Since $F(\\Phi(y),y) \\Longrightarrow f(\\Phi(y))=y$, it follows that $\\Phi$ is the local inverse $f^{1}$ by definition. Because $f$ itself is $C^1$ and $\\Phi=f^{-1}$ is also $C^1$, we conclude that $f^{-1}$ is a local diffeomorphism near $x_0$, which shows (1).

He presents a radical historical analysis of knowledge in The Order of Things, intending to eliminate the assumption of unchanging criteria for knowledge.\nThis quote sits at the center of his archaeological method, in which he attempted \u0026ldquo;to bring to light\u0026rdquo; the underlying episteme of knowledge. This recursive long sentence, broken down into three main modifiers, describes the epistemological field, which almost, if not intentionally, resembles the idea of a \u0026ldquo;field\u0026rdquo; in physics - an invisible but structured influence that determines how objects behave within it. The traditional epistemological assumption that he challenged holds that knowledge is grounded by universal standards of rationality and objectivity, and the first modifier sets the stage for this argument. Foucault subverts this unchanging framework by treating it as historically contingent, or specifically, one of the possible conditions \u0026ldquo;having reference\u0026rdquo; to rationality and objectivity.\nThe second modifier, \u0026ldquo;grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history,\u0026rdquo; presents one of his most radical takes on epistemology. The positivity of knowledge is constructed within the space established by the historical a priori, is thus validated by what is possible to be discovered as \u0026ldquo;knowledge.\u0026rdquo; For Foucault, the corresponding relationship between how well knowledge describes reality and knowledge itself is radically destabilized, because there is no objective guarantee of such a relationship, given that epistemes structure our perception and thus make reality itself historically conditioned.\nThe third modifier further develops this idea and explicitly rejects the notion of a progression of knowledge towards \u0026ldquo;growing perfection.\u0026rdquo; It is surprising for me to interpret that not only is progression non-linear and discontinuous, but progression itself simply cannot exist, precisely because epistemic ruptures shift the framework of what counts as knowledge and make previous ways of thinking unthinkable. (It reminds me of Thomas Kuhn\u0026rsquo;s view on science, but the preservation of continuity is completely abandoned.) Since the episteme structures the conditions under which the history of knowledge unfolds, it determines the framework within which historical institutions and discourses \u0026ldquo;ground\u0026rdquo; knowledge as legitimate.\nThis directly supports his examination of discourses on madness, crime, and sexuality, and how the changing episteme of madness throughout history, for example, redefines its implications - whether through the logic of confinement or its later medicalization under psychiatric authority. My close reading of this passage really forced me to zoom out from the sciences I have been studying and reflect on the historical illusion of epistemic progress.\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/docs/Philosophy/Object-petit-a/","title":"Object Petit A","section":"Philosophy","content":"What is $\\mathbb{objet; petit; a}$?\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/docs/Philosophy/%E7%A6%8F%E6%9F%AF%E8%A7%86%E8%A7%92%E4%B8%8B%E7%9A%84%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86%E5%AD%A6%E8%BD%AC%E5%8F%98%E4%BB%A5%E5%8F%8A%E6%96%B0%E8%8C%83%E5%BC%8F%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD/","title":"福柯视角下的物理学转变以及新范式的可能","section":"Philosophy","content":"我相信，\n翻开《词与物》没读完第一章就合上了，然后草率地读了结尾——我实在对这种节奏巨慢的历史学庞杂征引感到索然无味，以至于不得不读两页国内的数学书来综合一下\u0026hellip; 我对物理学的态度，以及对其研究方向的直觉，远远大于我本身可以延展他们的能力（很可惜，否则我必然毫不犹豫的投身其中）。但是幸运的是，对于基础科学来说，这会是人类历史当中，提出正确的问题所能带给我们的效益最大话的时代。我真正需要提出他对知识进行了激进的历史分析，并且构建了和绝大部分的科学家秉持的认识论有悖的历史断裂式“知识论领域”。\n所谓的知识论领域，原文里说：\n[\u0026hellip;] epistemological field, the episteme in which knowledge, envisaged apart from all criteria having reference to its rational value or to its objective forms, grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history which is not that of its growing perfection, but rather that of its conditions of possibility.\n当我第一时间看到他所说的知识的“field”的时候，想到的不是传统翻译里的“领域”，而是一种十分类似于物理学中的“场”的概念：一种不可见但结构化的影响力，决定了其中对象的行为方式。而这种受“场”所预设的知识的构建轨迹就相比于光在大质量黑洞旁边的行动——似乎光仅仅是依照着它的准则，一种肉眼可见的弯曲道路行进，但是实际上，他们在被引力场所弯曲的预设时空中，走直线（基于理性的客观性的知识发展）便是所见的“弯路”。但是福柯真正所面临的问题在于，如果沿用以上的类比，我们无从以观测者的身份知道以什么是直线，而什么是弯曲。\n作为其考古学方法的核心，福柯试图“揭示”知识的基础认识型（épistémè），以及其认识论场（epsitomalogical field）的历史性变化。福科挑战了传统认识论，那些所有基于理性与客观性的普遍标准的认知框架，并且将他们都视为了历史偶然（或成为了原文所说的，指向\u0026quot;理性与客观性的\u0026quot;可能条件\u0026quot;之一）。\n知识“确立其实证性（positivité）并由此展现历史”，呈现了他对认识论最激进的观点之一。知识的实证性在历史先验（a priori historique）建立的空间中被建构，因而通过能被发现为\u0026quot;知识\u0026quot;（savoir）的事物获得有效性。对福柯而言，知识描述现实的有效性与知识本身之间的对应关系被根本性动摇，因为这种关系没有客观保证——由于认识型构建了我们的感知，从而使现实本身具有历史条件性。\n他明确拒绝知识向\u0026quot;日益完善\u0026quot;（perfection croissante）进步的观念。这或许是他的认知论最激进的观点之一，进步不仅不是线性且连续的，而是进步本身根本不可能存在——因为认识型断裂（rupture épistémologique）会改变何为知识的框架，并使先前的思维方式变得不可想象（impensable）（哪怕是和他类似的托马斯·库恩的断裂式科学观中的连续性，也被完全抛弃）。由于认识型构建了知识史展开的条件，它决定了历史制度与话语将知识\u0026quot;确立\u0026quot;为合法性的框架。\n这用来支撑了他对疯狂、犯罪与性态话语的考察，例如历史上不断变化的疯狂认识型如何通过禁闭（confinement）逻辑或精神病学权威下的医学化重新定义其内涵。我对这段文本的细读迫使自己跳出正在研究的科学领域，反思所谓\n如果我们接受认识论进步是某一种历史幻觉，那么重新评估物理学的转变，于是我们便可以说：\n相对论的诞生并没有超越了牛顿力学，取得了更加正确的结论，而仅仅是知识论领域场从绝对时空转移到了相对时空——这是一种“épistémè”的转移。那么至于相对时空对物理现实的逼进是否优于绝对时空，这个问题是无法以绝对正确的方式被提出的，因为现代物理学的范式 - 实验，证伪性，同行评估 - 已经被塑造成了评估这个问题的核心范式。从历史学的角度上说，爱因斯坦的弯曲几何、薛定谔的波函数，本质上都是权力配置知识生产的历史先验（a priori historique）。物理学史中那些被视为“自然”的真理秩序在福科的认识论范围内被彻底解构。\n那么\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/docs/Physics/Quantum-Mechenics/Chapter-1-The-Wave-Function/","title":"Chapter 1 the Wave Function","section":"Quantum Mechenics","content":"To find a particle\u0026rsquo;s wave function, $\\psi(x,t)$, we solve:\nlogically analogous to Newton\u0026rsquo;s Second Law $F=ma$\n[!definition] Schrodinger\u0026rsquo;s Equation $$i\\hbar \\frac{ \\partial \\Psi}{ \\partial t}=-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{ \\partial^{2}\\Psi}{ \\partial x^{2} }+V \\Psi$$\nwhere Planck\u0026rsquo;s constant $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2\\pi}=1.054573 \\times 10^{-34}$.\n[!definition] Born\u0026rsquo;s Statistical Interpretation $$\\int^{a}_{b} |\\Psi(x,t)^{2}| , dx $$ which is the probability finding the particle between $a$ and $b$.\nIt is natural to wonder whether it is a fact of nature, or a defect in theory.\nThree quantum indeterminacy position: # realist the particle was at C.

Apply the Contraction Mapping Principle (CMP) to: $$ g_y(x) = y + x - f(x) = y + g(x) $$ Then $g_y(x): B(0, \\delta) \\to B(0, \\delta)$. Thus, there exists a unique $x \\in B(0, \\delta)$ such that: $$ g_y(x) = x \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad f(x) = y $$ Therefore, $\\exists! x \\in U$ such that $f(x) = y$.\nFix $y, y_1, y_2 \\in W$, let $x_i = f^{-1}(y_i), i = 1,2$.
