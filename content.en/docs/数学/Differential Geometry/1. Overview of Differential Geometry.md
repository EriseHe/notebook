## 1. From Calculus to Manifolds
- In multivariable calculus we study **parametrized surfaces** $X: U \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$.
- A parametrization is **regular** if the tangent vectors $X_u=\partial_u X$ and $X_v=\partial_v X$ are linearly independent at each point (so $dX$ has rank $2$).

> [!definition|1.1] Smooth manifold
> A $2$–manifold (surface) is a space that can be covered by coordinate patches $\{(U_\alpha,\varphi_\alpha)\}$ with homeomorphisms $\varphi_\alpha:U_\alpha\to\mathbb{R}^2$ whose **transition maps** $\varphi_\beta\circ\varphi_\alpha^{-1}$ are smooth wherever defined.  
> Higher–dimensional manifolds are defined similarly with $\mathbb{R}^n$.

- Some surfaces (e.g., the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$) **require multiple patches**; the inverses of the transition maps must be smooth as well.

## 2. Riemannian Metrics and Length

> [!definition|2.1] Riemannian Metric
> On a manifold $M$, a Riemannian metric $g$ assigns to each $p\in M$ an inner product $g_p$ on $T_pM$, varying smoothly with $p$. It provides infinitesimal distance via the quadratic form $ds^2$.

- For a smooth curve $\gamma:I\to M$, its **length** is
$$
\begin{aligned}
L(\gamma)
&=\int_I \|\gamma'(t)\|_{g}\,dt
=\int_I \sqrt{g_{\gamma(t)}\!\big(\gamma'(t),\gamma'(t)\big)}\,dt.
\end{aligned}
$$
### 2.1. First Fundamental Form on a Surface
Let $X(u,v)$ be a regular parametrization of a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Set
$$
\begin{aligned}
E &= \langle X_u,X_u\rangle \\
F &= \langle X_u,X_v\rangle \\
G &= \langle X_v,X_v\rangle.
\end{aligned}
$$
> [!definition|2.2] First Fundamental Form
> The metric in coordinates $(u,v)$ is
> $$\begin{aligned}
> ds^2 &= E\,du^2 + 2F\,du\,dv + G\,dv^2
> \end{aligned}$$
> a smoothly varying quadratic form that encodes lengths, angles, and areas on the surface.

- **Angle** between tangent vectors $V,W$ at the same point:
$$
\cos\theta=\frac{g(V,W)}{\sqrt{g(V,V)}\sqrt{g(W,W)}}.
$$
- **Area element** in coordinates:
$$
dA=\sqrt{EG-F^2}\;du\,dv.
$$

## 3. Curvature
- For a **plane curve**, curvature $\kappa$ is $1/R$, the reciprocal of the radius $R$ of the osculating circle.
- On a **surface**, one studies how normal sections bend; from this one obtains the **Gaussian curvature** $K$ (intrinsic) and the **mean curvature** $H$ (extrinsic).

> [!theorem|3.1]
> **Theorema Egregium (Gauss)**  
> The Gaussian curvature $K$ of a surface depends **only** on the first fundamental form $g$ (i.e., it is an intrinsic invariant) and **not** on how the surface sits in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

- **Example (Unit sphere)**: On $\mathbb{S}^2$ of radius $1$, $K\equiv 1$. For a spherical triangle $\Delta$,
$$
\sum \text{(angles of }\Delta\text{)}=\pi+\operatorname{area}(\Delta).
$$

## 4. Normal/Geodesic Coordinates and Curvature as a Quadratic Correction
Around any point $p$ of a Riemannian manifold there exist **geodesic normal coordinates** $(x^1,\dots,x^n)$ such that at $p$ the metric equals the Euclidean metric and first derivatives of $g$ vanish. In such coordinates near $p$,
$$
\begin{aligned}
g_{ij}(x) &= \delta_{ij} + \tfrac{1}{3}\sum_{k,\ell} R_{ikj\ell}(p)\,x^k x^\ell \;+\; O(|x|^3),
\end{aligned}
$$
so the **quadratic correction** to the Euclidean metric records the Riemann curvature tensor $R$. For a surface ($n=2$), this quadratic term is determined by the single function $K$.
