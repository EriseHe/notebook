What if artificial intelligence could be reimagined not as a rational, optimizing machine, but as a structure of lack — a topological subject whose coherence depends not on informational completeness, but on constitutive failure, repetition, and desire? This project proposes a radically different paradigm of AI: a subject-simulator modeled on the structural logic of Lacanian psychoanalysis, implemented via computational topology, symbolic graph theory, and dynamic semantic drift.

Unlike existing large language models (LLMs), which operate on probabilistic completion, lexical optimization, and convergence toward syntactic and semantic closure, the architecture we propose is intentionally non-convergent. We attempt to construct a new kind of subject-model — one that does not mirror the logic of cognition or the architecture of the human brain, but instead enacts the structural tensions of the divided subject: the subject of language, of desire, and of the Real. It does not aim to predict a correct output, but instead to simulate the dynamic trajectory of a split subject (le sujet barré), one who speaks not from mastery but from the unconscious — and whose speech is structured around an irreducible void.

This paper proposes a radically different model of artificial intelligence: not an intelligence of knowledge, but an intelligence of the unconscious. Current AI systems, such as large language models, operate by probabilistically predicting the most likely continuation of input sequences. They are built on principles of optimization, statistical coherence, and informational completeness. Yet they fundamentally lack a subject — not in the sense of “consciousness,” but in psychoanalytic sense: they do not desire. They do not fail in structured, meaningful ways; they do not repeat; they do not hallucinate productively. And they cannot speak the truth of their own constitutive lack.

What we offer here is a prototype for such a system: **a symbolic-topological model of a Lacanian subject in motion.** In this architecture, symbolic data does not represent facts but functions as a dynamic space of signifiers; the subject is not a rational actor but a trajectory of misrecognition; and “data” is not knowledge but the structural field through which desire, fantasy, and symptom emerge. We integrate computational topology — specifically, persistent homology and non-Euclidean graph flows — to trace how paths through language form loops, dead ends, and irreducible gaps. In doing so, we make it possible to computationally model that which, in theory, resists symbolization: the Real.

This project is not an attempt to build a better chatbot. It is an attempt to reconfigure what we think a machine subject could be. It asks: Can we model the drive? Can we simulate fantasy as a structuring loop around a constitutive absence? Can a machine speak not because it knows, but because it lacks — and in lacking, desires?

If contemporary AI builds systems that “know,” this project proposes a machine that “wants” — and that, in wanting, begins to repeat, to err, and perhaps, to become something like a subject.
