### Why Foucauldian Individualism May Fails in East Asia

In The History of Sexuality, Volume 1, Michel Foucault posits that modern power functions along two axes. Disciplinary power trains, supervises, and corrects individual bodies through institutions and techniques, while regulatory power, the “biopolitics of the population”, emerged in eighteenth-century Europe as states began to optimize and manage life itself via statistical-medical regimes. This latter form—biopower—is not merely a technical add-on to classical sovereign power, but a new modality that disciplines, monitors, and governs human life on a mass-level governance.

As a foundational text for many feminist discrouse, the history of sexualities suggests a rupture-like transformation between pre-modern moral orders and modern state-driven biopolitics. Such break of continuities, the foucauldian narratives of “before/after” story, is naturally deduced from the urgency for states to shift from “the right to kill” to “the power to foster life”, inevitably cultivated by the development of capitalism from the 18th century onward. However, such decisive transformation arises not from the essence of modern power itself, but from the specificities of the European historical context, and potentially foucault's limited engagement with cultural distinctions. 

In East-Asia, states rarely directly governed “bare” gendered individuals or abstract populations, but always through some relational hierarchies—household duties, filial piety, lineage honor, grounded in millennia-old Confucian traditions. This relational discipline both reinforces and contests the family-state continuum, and point toward a collective-self technologies that Foucauldian individualism may overlooked. Therefore, I argue that western-style censuses, public-health boards, and population-control policies, did not override indigenous norms, instead more seamlessly merged with pre-existing Confucian moral-familial hierarchies, producing what I may call a “familial biopower”—a hybrid model in which state governance is deeply mediated by family unit and its lineage, rather than the isolated individual. Hence, unlike the sudden shift often presumed in European contexts, the emergence of familial biopower in East Asia preserved more continuity than where biopower was originally posited.

### Foucauldian Genealogy & Its Individualist Horizon

Foucault famously traced how Western power moved *inside* bodies and *across* populations, as he pin-down “an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations”. His analysis assumed a degree of individualization: power acted on individual bodies through discipline and on masses of individuals through biopolitics of population. in East Asian contexts, specifically Japan and China, biopower is mediated through a Confucian-familial apparatus that fuses state governance with kinship obligations. In these societies, the boundaries between public authority and private family life are historically blurred by Confucian norms that make the family a microcosm of the state. As a result, power disciplines subjects relationally—through duties to family and ancestors, filial debts to parents, and the pursuit of lineage honor—rather than solely as atomized individuals. 

This relational, collective mode of discipline exposes the limits of what we might call Foucauldian individualism in understanding power. It compels a rethinking of Foucault’s “technologies of the self” as not only individual practices but potentially collective self-care strategies. Significantly, East Asian feminist movements have pioneered such collective ethics of self-care, from mutual-aid networks of single women to shared eldercare arrangements. These practices both reproduce and contest the family-state continuum, creating a distinctive form of gendered biopolitics beyond the scope of classic Confucian patriarchy or canonical Foucault.

Power thus operates at the level of individual normalization and collective regulation. Importantly, even when addressing populations, Foucault’s analysis presupposes individual subjects – citizens, workers, patients – who internalize norms. Modern power, he argues, is encoded into everyday practices and behavior as individuals gradually acquiesce to “subtle regulations and expectations of the social order”. Foucault’s genealogy of biopower in Europe centers on the individual as the basic unit of both discipline and resistance.

Behind this focus lies a distinctive Euro-modern split between public and private realms. Liberal thought (from which Foucault often departs but implicitly references) posited the family as a private sphere, separate from the state. While Foucault did analyze institutions like prisons, schools, and asylums, he paid comparatively less attention to the family as a locus of modern power. When family appeared in his work, it was often as a conduit for sexuality and disciplinary norms rather than an extension of the state itself. For instance, in The History of Sexuality, Foucault noted that bourgeois society of the 18th–19th centuries deployed sexuality “by way of the family,” turning the household into a device of sexual regulation rather than merely repression([PDF] Michel Foucault's ​Confessions of the Flesh.​ The fourth volume of ...)

Thus, implicit in Foucauldian biopower is a model of the subject as an individual self, embedded in networks of power but ultimately separable for analysis. Resistance, too, often appears as individual ethical work or localized subversion. While Foucault acknowledged collective phenomena (such as the statistics of population or the concept of “species-life” (Biopower - Wikipedia)), the subject of biopower remains the individual body or the abstract aggregate of many individuals. What happens, then, if the subject is not imagined as an autonomous individual but as fundamentally relational – constituted through family ties and obligations? This is precisely the case that Confucian thought posits and that Japan and China have institutionalized. show that in East Asia, the state historically governs not above or against the family, but *through* it, creating a biopolitical regime in which the primary target is the interlocked family unit and its lineage, rather than the isolated individual. This requires expanding Foucault’s framework to include kinship-based power and examining how such power can complicate notions of private versus public.

- Pre-modern lineage governance: 家 (jiā) / ie as both economic unit and ritual polity.
- Meiji Civil Code \& Republican China civil law: codifying patri-filial hierarchy as modern citizenship.
- Colonial overlays (Japan in Korea/Taiwan) that graft scientific hygiene onto filial morality.
- Conceptual synthesis $\rightarrow$ "familial biopower": state measures life through kinship ties (censuses by household, hukou system, koseki).

### Conclusion
























"discourse-knowledge-institutions," which he calls the dispositif (apparatus). This management of life constitutes his concept of biopower.
In other words, the state and society do not forbid discussions about sex. Rather, they compel individuals to speak about and practice sex within certain prescribed discursive boundaries, thereby transforming them into governable subjects.




It is because, in East Asia, the emergence of biopower was experienced less as a rupture or novel development, and more as a seamless integration with pre-existing disciplinary systems, thus forming a hybridized mode of governance. While one might assert that Foucault’s fundamental framework has universal applicability - power operates not merely as a unidirectional oppressive force but also through the production and regulation of knowledge and discourses around sex, love, and reproduction - East Asian societies already possessed deeply embedded practices of corporeal and behavioral regulation, shaped profoundly by Confucian patriarchal ideologies, familial hierarchies, and communal surveillance norms.

Dispositifs are the mechanisms—the apparatuses of discourse, institution, and practice—through which biopower is exercised.

Chizuko Ueno, by referencing Michel Foucault’s insight in The History of Sexuality, aims explicitly to transplant his analytical framework into the specific domain of the modern family in Japan.
Family as the Primary Apparatus


Western trajectory: In Europe the primary sites of Foucault’s “apparatus” tend to be institutions like prisons, clinics, schools and “the clinic” of sexology—spaces where medicine, law, and pedagogy intersect to produce norms. The family appears, if at all, only peripherally in his analyses. Romantic love and marriage gradually become individualized, and sexuality becomes a field of personal emancipation (e.g. the sexual revolution), often decoupled from state-level population management.


East Asian trajectory: In China and Japan, the family (rooted in Confucian norms of filial piety and hierarchical household order) has long been both a moral and an administrative unit—responsible not only for upbringing and inheritance, but also directly enlisted by the state for population control (e.g. family registers, marriage licensing, birth incentives/restrictions). Ueno shows that romantic love, which in the West came to be seen as a counter-tradition to arranged or duty-bound marriage, is in East Asia grafted onto the family’s regulatory core rather than set against it.


Seamless Fusion of Privates and Publics


In many Western societies, the “private” sphere of personal relationships and the “public” sphere of state bureaucracy have become conceptually separate—think of the liberal distinction between the family-home (private) and the nation-state (public). Even when the state intervenes in reproduction or health, it does so through agencies that are institutionally distinct from the family.


In China and Japan, Ueno argues, there is no such clear separation: the state’s biopolitical interests are exercised through the family itself. Marriage law, patriarchal headship (家長制), and medical technologies (contraception, abortion regulations) are not merely adjuncts but integral parts of the same dispositif that grants the illusion of romantic “freedom” while simultaneously monitoring and disciplining bodies and affections within the family context.




Foucault’s Europe is marked by the decline of explicit religious‐moral control and the rise of secular, expert-driven norms. His analysis focuses on how new sciences (demography, medicine, sexology) supplanted religious prohibition.


In East Asia, Confucian moral codes never fully retreated; they were instead co-opted by modern bureaucracies. Ueno demonstrates that the “freedom” to choose one’s partner or to speak of sexuality is always circumscribed by both ancient obligations (filial piety, family honor) and modern regulations (public-health mandates, eugenic policies). This dual heritage means the East Asian “family apparatus” operates at a different discursive pitch than anything Foucault observed in 18th–19th-century France.


Implications for Feminist Practice


Because the family in East Asia is a composite biopolitical instrument, Ueno shows that any feminist strategy must contend simultaneously with Confucian-patriarchal doctrines and with state-run public-health or population campaigns. In the West, feminists could target, say, marital laws separately from medical regulation; in China and Japan, these are facets of the same apparatus.

 biopower as a set of techniques for governing life—shaping how people live, reproduce, and regulate themselves—through networks of institutions and norms. In Foucault’s European account, those networks tend to look like schools, prisons, hospitals, census bureaus and so on. Power filters down through these discrete, public institutions and then back up into a statistical view of the population.
When the family becomes the primary node in that network, everything shifts:
Sites of Surveillance Move Into the Home


Instead of going to a clinic or school where you’re examined, your everyday relationships—with parents, in-laws, community elders—constantly monitor you. Home visits by local health officials, family registers (household registration), and even neighborhood associations turn the domestic space into an extension of the state’s gaze. Biopower here doesn’t just discipline bodies in professional settings; it disciplines them via emotional bonds and filial duties.


Normalization Through Moral Duty, Not Just Expert Knowledge


In Europe, a public‐health pamphlet or a census report carries authority because it’s presented as “objective science.” In East Asia, moral injunctions (“a good daughter‐in‐law doesn’t complain,” “you owe your father a healthy heir”) carry equal or greater force, because they tap into centuries of Confucian ethics. The result is a double bind: you’re governed both by modern scientific discourse and by ancestral moral imperatives, often reinforcing one another.


Decentralized Implementation of State Policies


Instead of a Ministry of Health sending inspectors to factories, the state mobilizes local family heads or neighborhood committees to enforce birth quotas, vaccination drives, or school attendance. This makes biopolitical measures far more pervasive—every family becomes a mini–public health office or census post.


Emotional Investment as a Vector of Power


Because power operates through love, respect, and duty, it’s more difficult to resist: rebelling against a school rule is one thing; refusing to obey your parents or bring shame on your family is quite another. Biopower here works not only by threat of fines or jail, but by guilt, honor, and familial expectation.


Resistance Looks Different


In a Western model you might protest in the streets or lobby a health department. In a family‐centered model, resistance often takes the form of private refusal—a daughter quietly delaying marriage, a sister withholding family register details, or an entire household relocating to avoid inspection. Those acts of “invisible” resistance arise precisely because power is embedded in the home, not just in visible institutions.


In short, when the family is the core apparatus of biopower, governance becomes more intimate, more morally charged, and more decentralized. The “machinery” of power lives in everyday relationships, so the techniques of surveillance, normalization, and population management operate through kinship ties just as much as through schools or hospitals.










Through initiatives such as the establishment of institutional platforms like the Women’s Action Network (WAN), her active participation in shaping feminist public policy, and her strategic dissemination of feminist theory via widely accessible media including her acclaimed manga "Understanding Feminism," Ueno translates Foucault’s complex analytical insights into viable feminist praxis.
systematically reconfigures the concept to resonate with the region’s distinct historical and cultural frameworks
I argue that Ueno’s adaptation of Foucauldian feminist theory necessitates a reevaluation of biopower within East Asia, positioning it not as a derivative expansion of Foucault’s European framework, but as a distinctive synthesis that incorporates indigenous Confucian moral disciplines with imported Western biopolitical technologies. In doing so, Ueno effectively resolves the theoretical impasse between Foucauldian critical analysis and actionable feminist strategies, proposing an intellectually rigorous and historically nuanced paradigm suitable for addressing the complexities of power within non-Western contexts.
Chizuko Ueno’s Application of Foucauldian Framework in Analyzing the Modern Family



Ueno’s Adaptation of Foucault’s Insights
Ueno transposes Foucault’s concept of the dispositif directly into the seemingly private and natural domains of romantic love, marriage, and reproduction. She argues that within the modern marriage institution, love, sexuality, and reproduction are systematically combined into what she identifies as a "family apparatus."
This apparatus simultaneously grants individuals a sense of "freedom" in romantic relationships, yet continuously monitors and disciplines their bodies and emotions through mechanisms such as marriage institutions, patriarchal norms, and medical practices (e.g., contraception, abortion). This is precisely the projection of Foucault’s discourse-knowledge-power chain into family life.
When Ueno characterizes love, sexuality, and reproduction under the marriage principle as essentially a "trinity-like apparatus," she underscores how the Foucauldian mechanism—where power regulates life through sexual discourse—effectively constitutes the overarching structure of the modern family.
Analysis of Double Standards
Ueno further extends Foucault’s framework by highlighting gender-specific disciplinary practices within this familial apparatus: "sometimes men's love can be reduced merely to sexuality, whereas women's... can only be reduced to maternal love." Here, she reveals the differential disciplinary labeling imposed upon men and women, maintaining patriarchal order through a dual standard.
Thus, referencing The History of Sexuality is not to highlight novel aspects of sexual psychology, but rather to emphasize that even seemingly natural phenomena such as love, marriage, and reproduction are deliberately constructed, discursively produced, and systematically disciplined under power mechanisms.
 Ueno deploys Foucault’s dispositif model—concerning the nexus of power-discourse-biopolitics—as an analytical tool to dissect how romantic love, sexuality, and reproduction within the modern family have become institutionalized and subject to systematic surveillance and regulation. This is precisely why she explicitly invokes The History of Sexuality.
