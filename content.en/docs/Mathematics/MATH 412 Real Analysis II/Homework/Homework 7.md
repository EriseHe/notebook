Let $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 + 3y^3 + 8x^4 + x^2e^x \sin x + 6$. Show that there exist new coordinates $\xi, \eta$, where
$$\xi = \xi(x,y), \quad \eta = \eta(x,y),$$
for which
$$f(x,y) = \xi^2 + \eta^2 + 6$$
in a neighborhood of $(0, 0)$.

(a).
If $f$ has a nondegenerate critical point at $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$, show that there is a neighborhood of $x_0$ containing no other critical points.

(b).
What are the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^2y^2$?

Supranational Sludge Corporation produces sludge using equipment and material costing $p = \$243$ per unit and labor at a wage of $w = \$16$ per hour. If $x$ units of equipment/material and $y$ hours of labor are used, then $20x^{3/4}y^{1/4}$ liters of sludge are produced. If the company has a budget of $B = \$51,840,000$ to spend, find the maximum amount of sludge that can be produced and the amounts of equipment/material and of labor used to produce it.

Let $B(0, r) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \|x\| \leq r\}$. Let $f : B(0, r) \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a map with

a.
$\|f(x) - f(y)\| \leq \frac{1}{3}\|x - y\|$

b.
$\|f(0)\| \leq \frac{2}{3}r$

Prove that there is a unique $x \in B(0, r)$ such that $f(x) = x$.
