# Standard Quantum Models: Infinite Well, Finite Well, Delta Potential, Free Particle, and Harmonic Oscillator

**Introduction:** Chapter 2 of Griffiths’ *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (3rd Ed.)* introduces several fundamental one-dimensional quantum models. These include the **infinite square well** (an idealized particle-in-a-box), the **finite square well** (a box with finite walls allowing tunneling), the **delta-function potential** (an extremely narrow attractive well), the **free particle** (no potential at all), and the **harmonic oscillator** (a particle in a parabolic potential). These models build on one another logically. We begin with the infinite well as a baseline, then generalize to finite wells. In the limit of a very narrow deep finite well we obtain the delta-function potential, and if we remove the confining walls we recover the free particle as a special case. Finally, we discuss the harmonic oscillator as a separate class of smoothly varying potential. Each section below provides a conceptual explanation, the physical setup and assumptions, key equations with boundary conditions, a step-by-step problem-solving workflow, and a standard example with results. The notation follows Griffiths’ textbook conventions for consistency. By studying these models, one gains practical problem-solving skills and exam readiness in solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation for various potentials.

## Infinite Square Well

**Concept and Physical Setup:** The infinite square well (also known as the particle-in-a-box) is the simplest quantum well. It models a particle free to move in a region of space of width \$a\$ (often taken from \$x=0\$ to \$x=a\$) but confined by impenetrable barriers at the boundaries. Outside the region, the potential \$V(x)\$ is infinite, so the particle **cannot escape**. Inside the well, \$V(x)=0\$ (no forces act inside). Classically, a particle in a box could have any energy and position, but quantum mechanically it can only occupy discrete energy levels and its wavefunction forms standing waves within the well. The infinite potential walls impose **boundary conditions** that the wavefunction \$\psi(x)\$ must go to zero at the walls. This leads to quantization of allowed states.

**Key Equations and Boundary Conditions:** The time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) inside the well (\$0\<x\<a\$) is:

$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = E\,\psi(x),$

since \$V(x)=0\$ inside. This simplifies to \$\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = -\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi\$. Denoting \$k=\sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}}\$, the general solution inside is a linear combination of sine and cosine: \$\psi(x)=A\sin(kx)+B\cos(kx)\$. The boundary conditions are \$\psi(0)=0\$ (impenetrable wall at \$x=0\$) and \$\psi(a)=0\$ (wall at \$x=a\$). Applying \$\psi(0)=0\$ forces \$B=0\$ (so the cosine term vanishes). Applying \$\psi(a)=0\$ then gives \$A\sin(ka)=0\$. For a non-trivial solution (\$A\neq0\$), we require \$\sin(k a)=0\$, which implies

$k a = n\pi, \qquad n = 1,2,3,\dots.$

This **quantization condition** means only certain wavenumbers \$k\_n\$ are allowed: \$k\_n = \frac{n\pi}{a}\$. Correspondingly, the allowed energies are **discrete**:

$ E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 k_n^2}{2m} = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m a^2}n^2, \qquad n=1,2,3,\dots.$

These are the energy eigenvalues of the infinite well. The lowest energy (ground state) corresponds to \$n=1\$ and is

$ E_1 = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m a^2},$

which is **not zero** – a manifestation of the **zero-point energy** (the particle cannot be completely at rest because of confinement). Each energy level \$E\_n\$ increases with \$n^2\$, so higher levels are spaced farther apart in energy.

The normalized stationary wavefunctions (spatial part) are:

$\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin\!\Big(\frac{n\pi x}{a}\Big), \qquad 0<x<a,$

with \$\psi\_n(0)=\psi\_n(a)=0\$. These \$\psi\_n(x)\$ are orthonormal and have \$n-1\$ internal nodes (zeros) inside the well. For example, \$\psi\_1(x)\$ has no node inside (just zero at the ends), \$\psi\_2(x)\$ has one node at \$x=a/2\$, etc. The probability density \$|\psi\_n(x)|^2\$ is highest at the antinodes of the sine wave, indicating where the particle is most likely to be found.

&#x20;*Wavefunctions for the first four stationary states (\$n=1\$ to \$4\$) in an infinite square well of width \$a\$. Each \$\psi\_n(x)\$ is a sine wave confined to \$0\<x\<a\$, with \$n-1\$ interior nodes. Higher \$n\$ corresponds to higher energy \$E\_n\$ and an additional node.*

**Step-by-Step Solution Workflow for Infinite Well Problems:**

1. **Define the potential:** \$V(x)=0\$ for \$0\<x\<a\$ and \$V=\infty\$ outside this region. This specifies the region of motion and boundary conditions \$\psi(0)=\psi(a)=0\$.
2. **Solve Schrödinger’s equation inside the well:** Write the TISE for \$0\<x\<a\$ and solve the second-order ODE. You’ll obtain a general solution \$\psi(x)=A\sin(kx)+B\cos(kx)\$.
3. **Apply boundary conditions:** Enforce \$\psi(0)=0\$ \$\implies B=0\$. Enforce \$\psi(a)=0\$ \$\implies \sin(k a)=0\$. This yields the allowed \$k\_n = n\pi/a\$ (quantization).
4. **Obtain energy eigenvalues:** Plug \$k\_n\$ into \$E=\hbar^2 k^2/(2m)\$ to get \$E\_n = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m a^2}n^2\$.
5. **Normalize the eigenfunctions:** Determine the constant \$A\$ by normalization \$\int\_0^a |\psi\_n(x)|^2 dx=1\$. This gives \$A=\sqrt{2/a}\$, so \$\psi\_n(x)=\sqrt{2/a}\sin(n\pi x/a)\$.
6. **Analyze or use results:** You can now compute probabilities, expectation values, etc., using the \$\psi\_n(x)\$. Remember that only these discrete \$E\_n\$ are allowed for stationary states.

**Example (Infinite Well):** As a concrete example, consider an electron in an infinite well of width \$a=1.0\~\text{nm}\$. The ground-state energy is \$E\_1 = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m a^2}\$. Plugging in values (with \$m=m\_e\$ for electron, \$\hbar\approx1.055\times10^{-34}\$ J·s), one finds \$E\_1 \approx 0.38\~\text{eV}\$. The next level \$E\_2 = 4E\_1 \approx 1.5\~\text{eV}\$, and so on. Although these energies are small in eV, they are strictly fixed – the electron cannot have arbitrary energy in the well, only these quantized values. The normalized ground-state wavefunction is \$\psi\_1(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}\sin(\pi x/a)\$, which has its single antinode at \$x=a/2\$ (the particle is most likely to be found in the middle of the box) and goes to zero at the walls as required. Higher states \$\psi\_2, \psi\_3, ...\$ oscillate more rapidly inside the well. This infinite well model is often the first example in exams; typical tasks include deriving \$E\_n\$ and \$\psi\_n(x)\$, sketching the wavefunctions and probability densities, and using them to compute quantities like \$\langle x \rangle\$ or \$\langle p \rangle\$. It illustrates clearly how quantization emerges from boundary conditions in quantum mechanics.

## Finite Square Well

**Concept and Physical Setup:** The finite square well is a more realistic version of the infinite well, where the confining walls have finite height \$V\_0\$ instead of infinity. For an **attractive finite well**, one convenient convention is to take the potential \$V(x)\$ to be *zero outside* and *negative inside* a region. For example, a symmetric finite well centered at the origin can be defined as:

$$V(x) = \begin{cases}
- V_0, & |x| < a, \\
0, & |x| \ge a,
\end{cases}\] 
$$

with $V_0 > 0$ being the depth of the well. In the central region ($|x|<a$) the particle experiences a constant negative potential “well”, and outside ($|x|>a$) it faces a zero or higher potential. Classically, if the particle’s energy $E$ is less than the wall height (here 0, since inside is negative relative to outside), it could never escape the well. Quantum mechanically, however, there is a **non-zero probability of finding the particle outside the well** even for $E$ below the barrier, due to **tunneling**. The wavefunction no longer goes exactly to zero at $x=\pm a$; instead it decays exponentially outside the classically allowed region. The finite well thus introduces the ideas of **bound states with $E$ in a continuum background** and quantum tunneling.

**Key Equations and Matching Conditions:** We solve the TISE in three regions: Region I (left, $x<-a$), Region II (inside, $-a < x < a$), and Region III (right, $x>a$). Using the convention above (inside $V=-V_0$, outside $V=0$), the Schrödinger equation in each region is:

- For $x < -a$ (Region I, $V=0$): $\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = -\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi$. Solutions are exponentials or plane waves. For bound states ($E<0$ relative to outside), let $E=-\varepsilon$ (with $\varepsilon>0$). Then in the outside regions the equation becomes $\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = +\frac{2m\varepsilon}{\hbar^2}\psi$. Write the general solution as $\psi_I(x) = F e^{+\kappa x} + G e^{-\kappa x}$ for $x<-a$, where $\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{2m\varepsilon}{\hbar^2}}$. A physically acceptable bound-state solution must remain finite as $x\to -\infty$, so we set $F=0$ (to kill the growing exponential term). Thus $\psi_I(x) = G e^{-\kappa(x + a)}$ for $x<-a$ (decaying to the left of the well). Similarly, for $x>a$ (Region III) the general solution $\psi_{III}(x) = H e^{-\kappa x} + I e^{+\kappa x}$, and finiteness as $x\to +\infty$ requires $I=0$, so $\psi_{III}(x) = H e^{-\kappa(x - a)}$ for $x>a$ (decaying to the right). 

- For $-a < x < a$ (Region II, inside well, $V=-V_0$): The TISE reads $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\psi''(x) - V_0\psi = E\psi$. Or $\psi''(x) = -\frac{2m(E + V_0)}{\hbar^2}\psi$. Define $E = -\varepsilon$ as above, then $E + V_0 = V_0 - \varepsilon$. If $E$ is below the top of the well ($E<0$ but above the bottom $-V_0$), then $V_0 - \varepsilon$ is positive. Let $k = \sqrt{\frac{2m(V_0 - \varepsilon)}{\hbar^2}}$. Then inside the well the equation is $\psi''(x) = -k^2 \psi$, with general solution $\psi_{II}(x) = A\cos(kx) + B\sin(kx)$. (Some texts use cosine and sine for even/odd parity or equivalently $Ae^{ikx}+Be^{-ikx}$ forms.) 

Now we apply **boundary matching conditions** at the edges $x=\pm a$: $\psi$ must be continuous, and $\psi'$ (derivative) must be continuous as well, since the potential is finite (the Schrödinger equation and its derivative can be integrated across the boundary yielding continuity of $\psi$ and $\psi'$). In practice, apply at $x=a$: $\psi_{II}(a)=\psi_{III}(a)$ and $\psi'_{II}(a)=\psi'_{III}(a)$; similarly at $x=-a$: $\psi_{II}(-a)=\psi_{I}(-a)$ and $\psi'_{II}(-a)=\psi'_{I}(-a)$. These conditions yield a set of equations relating $A,B$ with $G$ and $H$. Because the well is symmetric about zero, one can simplify by classifying solutions into **even parity** (symmetric, $\psi$ even in $x$) and **odd parity** (antisymmetric, $\psi$ odd). For an even solution, we expect $B=0$ (so $\psi_{II}(x)=A\cos(kx)$, an even function) and $G=H$ (the outside decays have equal amplitude). For an odd solution, we expect $A=0$ ($\psi_{II}(x)=B\sin(kx)$, an odd function) and $G=-H$. Applying the continuity conditions under these parity assumptions leads to two transcendental equations for the allowed eigenvalues $E$: 

- **Even states:** $\kappa = k \tan(k a)$.  
- **Odd states:** $\kappa = -\,k \cot(k a)$.  

Here $k = \sqrt{\frac{2m(V_0 - \varepsilon)}{\hbar^2}}$ and $\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{2m\varepsilon}{\hbar^2}}$ are both functions of $E=-\varepsilon$. These equations cannot be solved in closed form for $E$, but they determine the allowed energies implicitly. Graphical or numerical methods are used: one plots $y=k\tan(k a)$ and $y=\kappa$ (for even) or $y=-k\cot(k a)$ and $y=\kappa$ (for odd) and finds their intersections, which give the solutions for $\varepsilon$ (and hence $E$). Each intersection corresponds to one bound state energy $E_n$. Because $\tan$ and $\cot$ are unbounded functions, there can be multiple intersections (multiple bound states) depending on the well depth $V_0$. If $V_0$ is large (deep well), there will be several allowed $n$; if $V_0$ is shallow, there may be only one. In fact, it can be shown that **at least one bound state always exists for any $V_0>0$** (no matter how shallow), but beyond that the number of bound states increases with $V_0$ and well width.

Bound-state energies $E$ lie in the range $-V_0 < E < 0$ (below the outside zero potential, but above the bottom of the well $-V_0$). For energies **above the well ($E \ge 0$)**, the particle is not bound; instead, we have **scattering states** (the particle comes in from one side and is partially transmitted and reflected by the well). Those $E \ge 0$ solutions form a continuous spectrum (the particle can have any energy above the well, similar to a free particle, but with a phase shift or possible resonance due to the well). In this summary, we focus on the bound states. 

**Practical Problem-Solving Steps for Finite Wells:**

1. **Define the potential and regions:** Write down $V(x)$ piecewise (inside the well of width $2a$ and outside). Identify the region I ($x<-a$), II ($-a<x<a$), III ($x>a$). Note that as $x \to \pm\infty$, $\psi$ must remain finite (usually $\psi \to 0$).  
2. **Solve the Schrödinger equation in each region:** Write the general solution in region II (inside) as $A\cos(kx)+B\sin(kx)$ (with $k = \sqrt{2m(E+V_0)}/\hbar$) and in the outside regions I and III as decaying exponentials $G e^{-\kappa(x+a)}$ for $x<-a$ and $H e^{-\kappa(x-a)}$ for $x>a$ (with $\kappa=\sqrt{2m(V_0+E)}/\hbar$ for bound states, where $E$ will be negative).  
3. **Apply boundary conditions at infinity:** Set the coefficients of any exponentially growing terms to zero, ensuring $\psi(\pm\infty)=0$. This gave us $F=0$ and $I=0$ as mentioned above.  
4. **Impose continuity at $x=\pm a$:** Set $\psi_I(-a)=\psi_{II}(-a)$, $\psi'_{I}(-a)=\psi'_{II}(-a)$, and similarly at $x=+a$. These yield four equations. Use the symmetry of the potential to simplify: assume either an even solution ($\psi$ symmetric) or odd solution ($\psi$ antisymmetric) to reduce the number of unknowns. This step yields the transcendental equations $\kappa = k \tan(k a)$ (even) or $\kappa = -\,k \cot(k a)$ (odd).  
5. **Solve for allowed energies:** Solve these transcendental equations for $\varepsilon = -E$ (usually by plotting or iteration). Each valid solution for $\varepsilon$ (with $0<\varepsilon<V_0$) gives an energy eigenvalue $E=-\varepsilon$. The number of solutions depends on the well depth. List the found $E_n$.  
6. **Construct eigenfunctions:** Plug each $E_n$ back in to find $k_n$ and $\kappa_n$, then get the corresponding normalized $\psi_n(x)$. Typically, you express $\psi_n$ piecewise (cosine inside for even states or sine inside for odd states, decaying exponentials outside). Use the continuity conditions to fix relative coefficients (e.g. determine $A$ vs $G$ etc.), and then normalize $\psi_n(x)$ over all space.  
7. **Analyze results:** The bound state wavefunctions will be sinusoidal in the well and exponentially decaying outside. Check that as $V_0 \to \infty$, your $E_n$ results approach those of the infinite well (they should, since the transcendental conditions in that limit force $k a = n\pi$). Also note that as $n$ increases, $\psi_n$ extends closer to the walls and $E_n$ approaches 0 from below (for a finite number of levels). 

:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} *Finite square well potential of depth $V_0$ and width $2a$, with three lowest bound state energy levels indicated (red lines, labeled $E1, E2, E3$). The potential $V(x) = -V_0$ for $|x|<a$ (light blue region) and $V(x)=0$ outside (dashed black lines). The bound state energies lie below 0 (the top of the well) and above $-V_0$ (the bottom). The wavefunctions (not shown) oscillate inside the well and decay exponentially in the classically forbidden outside regions.* 

**Example (Finite Well):** Consider a finite well of half-width $a=1$ nm and depth $V_0 = 5$ eV (inside $V=-5$ eV, outside $V=0$). Classically, an electron with $E<0$ (negative) would be trapped. Solving the transcendental equations for this case might show, for instance, that there are two bound states (one even, one odd). The ground state might come out to an energy $E_1 \approx -4$ eV (just 1 eV above the bottom of the well), and the first excited bound state $E_2 \approx -1$ eV. These would be found by finding solutions to $\kappa = k \tan(k a)$ and $\kappa = -k \cot(k a)$. The ground state wavefunction $\psi_1(x)$ would be an even function, largest at $x=0$, oscillating cosinusoidally inside (no nodes, since it’s the lowest state) and decaying evanescently for $|x|>a$. The first excited state $\psi_2(x)$ would be odd (one node at $x=0$), sine-shaped inside, and also decaying outside. If the well were made shallower (say $V_0=1$ eV), only one bound state would remain (the second level would “float” up into the continuum, no longer bound). If the well is made deeper or wider, more bound states appear. In exam problems, you might be asked to **determine how many bound states a given finite well supports**, or to solve the transcendental equations numerically for the energy values, or to sketch the wavefunctions qualitatively. A common practical exercise is to check the limiting cases: as $V_0 \to \infty$, the results approach the infinite square well (with $\psi$ going to zero at the boundaries); as $V_0 \to 0$, the well ceases to bind the particle and you approach the free particle case. The finite well exemplifies how allowing tunneling changes the quantization condition from a simple integer relation to a more complex one, and introduces the concept of *quantum tunneling* and *quasi-bound states*.

**Relation to Other Models:** The infinite well can be seen as the limiting case of a finite well as $V_0 \to \infty$ (the transcendental conditions force $\sin$ solutions and recover $E_n \propto n^2$). Conversely, if we make the finite well extremely narrow, it approaches the **delta-function potential** model (discussed next). If we remove the well altogether (letting $V_0 \to 0$ or the width $a \to \infty$), we approach the **free particle** case.

## Delta-Function Potential

**Concept and Setup:** The delta-function potential is an idealized potential that is zero everywhere except at a single point, where it is infinitely strong and narrow. We focus on the **attractive delta well**, defined by 

$$V(x) = -\alpha\,\delta(x),$$ 

where $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function and $\alpha>0$ sets the strength (with units of energy·length). This potential is like an extremely narrow deep well located at $x=0$. It can be thought of as the limit of a finite square well as the width $2a \to 0$ and depth $V_0 \to \infty$ such that the area $2a V_0$ approaches $\alpha$:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. Physically, the delta-function potential might model an impurity or a very short-range force (like an idealized chemical bond or a deep narrow trap). The particle feels no force except exactly at $x=0$. Despite the singular nature of $V(x)$, the Schrödinger equation can be solved by integrating across the singularity.

The delta well has one bound state (and only one) and a continuum of scattering states. The bound state is a localized state around $x=0$. Classically, an attractive spike would capture a particle only if its energy is negative (bound); in quantum mechanics, indeed one bound state with negative energy exists for any $\alpha>0$. Interestingly, *any* shallow delta well binds a particle in one dimension (no matter how weak $\alpha$ is, there will be a bound state, similar to the finite well scenario):contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. 

**Solving Schrödinger’s Equation:** For $x \neq 0$, the potential $V(x)=0$, so the time-independent Schrödinger equation is free everywhere except at $x=0$. For a bound state, we seek a solution decaying as $x\to \pm \infty$. Let the bound state energy be $E=-\varepsilon$ (with $\varepsilon>0$). Then for $x>0$, $\psi''(x) = \frac{2m\varepsilon}{\hbar^2}\psi(x)$ (since $E-V= -\varepsilon$ for $x\neq0$), whose general solution is $\psi(x)=C e^{-\kappa x} + D e^{+\kappa x}$ with $\kappa=\sqrt{\frac{2m\varepsilon}{\hbar^2}}$. Normalizability demands $\psi(x)$ not diverge as $x\to +\infty$, so we take $D=0$. Thus for $x>0$: $\psi(x)=C e^{-\kappa x}$. By symmetry of the potential (which is even), we expect an even bound state solution. Indeed, for $x<0$, by a similar reasoning, $\psi(x)=C e^{+\kappa x}$ (which decays for $x\to -\infty$). So we have 

$$\psi(x) = A e^{-\kappa |x|},$$ 

for some amplitude $A$, as the *ansatz* for the bound state wavefunction. This $\psi(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$ (both sides equal $A$). However, the derivative $\psi'(x)$ will have a discontinuity at $x=0$ because of the delta potential. The proper condition comes from integrating the Schrödinger equation from $-\,\epsilon$ to $+\epsilon$ around $0$. Doing this, one finds the jump condition: 

$$\psi'(+0) - \psi'(-0) = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\int_{-\epsilon}^{+\epsilon} [V(x)\psi(x)]\,dx = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(-\alpha)\psi(0).$$ 

Since $\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon}\delta(x)\,dx = 1$, this simplifies to: 

$$\psi'(+0) - \psi'(-0) = -\frac{2m\alpha}{\hbar^2}\psi(0).$$ 

Plugging our piecewise form $\psi(x)=A e^{-\kappa |x|}$: for $x>0$, $\psi'(x) = -\kappa A e^{-\kappa x}$ so $\psi'(+0) = -\kappa A$; for $x<0$, $\psi'(x) = +\kappa A e^{+\kappa x}$ so $\psi'(-0) = +\kappa A$. Thus the jump condition becomes $(-\kappa A) - (\kappa A) = -\frac{2m\alpha}{\hbar^2}A$. This gives $-2\kappa A = -\frac{2m\alpha}{\hbar^2}A$. Canceling $-2A$ (nonzero for a bound state), we get the **energy condition**: 

$$\kappa = \frac{m\alpha}{\hbar^2}.$$ 

Now recall $\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{2m\varepsilon}{\hbar^2}}$. Solving for $\varepsilon$ yields $\varepsilon = \frac{m^2\alpha^2}{2m\hbar^2} = \frac{m\alpha^2}{2\hbar^2}$. Therefore the **bound-state energy** is: 

$$E_{\text{bound}} = -\,\varepsilon = -\,\frac{m\alpha^2}{2\hbar^2}.$$ 

This is the single discrete eigenvalue for the delta well:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. The corresponding normalized wavefunction can be written as 

$$\psi(x) = \sqrt{\kappa}\, e^{-\kappa |x|},$$ 

where $\kappa = m\alpha/\hbar^2$ as above (the factor $\sqrt{\kappa}$ comes from normalization $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \kappa e^{-2\kappa |x|}dx=1$). This bound-state wavefunction is continuous and peaked at $x=0$ (where the delta well is located), and decays exponentially away from the center. Notably, $\psi(x)$ is cusp-like at $x=0$; its derivative has a finite discontinuity there because of the infinite spike of potential (unlike finite wells where $\psi'$ was continuous). 

:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23} *Bound state of an attractive delta-function potential $V(x)=-\alpha\,\delta(x)$. The red curve is the wavefunction $\psi(x) \propto e^{-|x|\kappa}$ with $\kappa = m\alpha/\hbar^2$. The blue dashed line indicates $\psi=0$. The black arrow at $x=0$ marks the location of the delta well (a negative spike). The wavefunction is continuous at $x=0$, but its slope has a discontinuity (steeper on the left side than the right side) due to the concentrated force at $x=0$. This single bound state has energy $E=-\frac{m\alpha^2}{2\hbar^2}$. *

For **scattering states** ($E>0$) in the delta potential, one solves the free Schrödinger equation on either side and applies the boundary/jump conditions. A typical scenario is a particle coming in from the left ($x=-\infty$) with energy $E=\hbar^2 k^2/(2m)$. One finds that part of the wave is reflected and part is transmitted. The reflection and transmission coefficients can be derived by matching at $x=0$. The result (for an attractive delta well or a repulsive delta barrier, depending on the sign of $\alpha$) is that there is partial reflection for all energies. For example, for a delta **well** ($\alpha>0$), the transmission probability for a particle of wave number $k$ is 

$$T = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{m\alpha}{\hbar^2 k}\right)^2},$$ 

and the reflection probability is $R=1-T$. One noteworthy fact is that as $E \to \infty$ (large $k$), $T \to 1$ but never exceeds 1, and as $E \to 0^+$, $T \to 0$ (the low-energy particle is mostly reflected by the attractive well because it effectively “bounces off” the sudden potential). These scattering states are not normalizable in the usual sense over $(-\infty,\infty)$, but they can be treated as delta-normalized or as limits of putting the system in a large box. 

**Steps to Solve Delta-Potential Problems:**

1. **Write down the potential:** $V(x)=-\alpha \delta(x)$. Identify that for $x \neq 0$, $V=0$, and at $x=0$ we have a special condition.  
2. **Solve Schrödinger’s equation for regions $x<0$ and $x>0$:** Both sides are free particle regions. For a bound state, take decaying exponentials; for scattering, take appropriate incoming/outgoing waves. Write general solutions: for $x<0$, $\psi_L(x) = A\,e^{\kappa x}+B\,e^{-\kappa x}$; for $x>0$, $\psi_R(x) = C\,e^{-\kappa x}+D\,e^{\kappa x}$ (for bound, choose decaying forms as needed, for scattering choose oscillatory $e^{\pm ikx}$ forms).  
3. **Apply continuity at $x=0$:*** $\psi_L(0)=\psi_R(0)$. This ensures the wavefunction is single-valued.  
4. **Apply the “jump” condition for $\psi'$:** $\psi'_R(0) - \psi'_L(0) = -\frac{2m\alpha}{\hbar^2}\psi(0)$. This comes from integrating Schrödinger’s equation over an infinitesimal interval around $0$. Plug in the forms of $\psi'$ from left and right.  
5. **Solve for constants and $E$:** For the bound state, this yields the condition $\kappa = m\alpha/\hbar^2$, giving $E=-m\alpha^2/(2\hbar^2)$. For scattering, solve for the reflection/transmission amplitudes (ratios of $B$ to incoming amplitude, etc.) to get $R,T$.  
6. **Normalize if needed:** The bound state should be normalized to 1 (determine $A$ accordingly). Scattering states are typically normalized to delta functions or flux; on an exam, you might just compute $R$ and $T$ rather than fully normalize $\psi$.  
7. **Interpret results:** Check that $E_{\text{bound}}$ is negative and depends on $\alpha$ quadratically. Note that if $\alpha$ is small, $E_{\text{bound}}$ is close to 0 (very shallow bound). Also, confirm that $R+T=1$ for scattering (probability current is conserved). 

**Example (Delta Well):** Suppose $\alpha = 5.0\times 10^{-40}$ J·m (a very weak well). Then the single bound state energy would be $E = -m\alpha^2/(2\hbar^2)$. For an electron ($m=9.11\times10^{-31}$ kg), plugging $\hbar=1.055\times10^{-34}$ J·s, we get $E \approx -1.3\times 10^{-21}$ J, which is about $-8\times10^{-3}$ eV. This tiny negative energy indicates a very shallow bound state, just below $E=0$. The wavefunction would be $\psi(x) = \sqrt{\kappa}e^{-\kappa|x|}$ with $\kappa = m\alpha/\hbar^2 \approx 1.0\times 10^{10}$ m$^{-1}$. The exponential decay length $1/\kappa$ is about $10^{-10}$ m (an angstrom), meaning the particle is localized mostly within angstroms of $x=0$. If a particle with a small positive energy (say $E=0.01$ eV) comes in, it will see this weak well and mostly pass by; we can calculate $T$ from the formula above. For larger $\alpha$ (stronger well), the bound state energy becomes more negative and the particle is more tightly localized. A delta-function potential is a common exam problem because it tests understanding of boundary conditions: one usually has to derive the jump condition and show that it yields the bound state energy, or compute reflection/transmission coefficients. It’s also conceptually important as a limiting case of a finite well (narrower and deeper):contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}.

## Free Particle

**Concept and Setup:** The free particle is a limiting case where the particle is not bound by any potential – **$V(x)=0$ everywhere** (for all $-\infty < x < +\infty$). It can be regarded as a finite well with no walls at all (for example, take the finite well and let $V_0 \to 0$, or imagine the infinite well with its width $a \to \infty$). A free particle experiences no forces, so classically it would move in a straight line with constant momentum. Quantum mechanically, the absence of boundaries or potential means there is no quantization of energy – the particle’s energy and momentum are continuous variables. Solving Schrödinger’s equation for a free particle yields plane-wave solutions representing particles with definite momentum. 

**Key Equations:** With $V(x)=0$, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is simply 

$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = E\psi(x),$$ 

which is the same form we solved inside the infinite well, but now valid for all $x$ without boundary constraints. The general solution is $\psi(x) = A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx}$, with $k=\sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$. Here $E=\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$ can be any non-negative value – there is **no restriction on $k$ or $E$** (no quantization):contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. We typically rewrite the two exponentials as representing a right-moving plane wave ($e^{ikx}$) and a left-moving plane wave ($e^{-ikx}$). 

For a free particle in a stationary state, if we try to normalize $\psi$ over the entire real line, we encounter an issue: plane waves are not square-integrable (the probability density $|\psi|^2$ is constant in space, so integrating over an infinite line diverges). This reflects that a truly free particle is not localized. In practice, we deal with this by either **normalizing to a delta function** (box normalization) or by considering wave packets (superpositions of plane waves that give localized wavefunctions). However, for most theoretical purposes, one considers the momentum eigenstates $|p\rangle$ corresponding to $\psi_p(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}}e^{ipx/\hbar}$.

If we imagine “confining” the free particle in a large box of length $L$ and taking $L\to\infty$, then the energy levels become so dense that they form a continuum. In the finite box of length $L$, one would have quantized $k_n = \frac{2\pi n}{L}$, but as $L \to \infty$ the spacing $\Delta k \to 0$ and $E$ becomes effectively continuous. Thus the free particle’s hallmark is a **continuous energy spectrum**: the particle can have any $E \ge 0$ (including $E=0$ as a limiting case of a perfectly constant wavefunction). Negative energy solutions for a free particle are not physically distinct – they correspond to imaginary $k$ which yields exponential solutions that are non-normalizable (they blow up or decay over infinite space), so we generally exclude negative $E$ for a truly free particle. 

**Physical Interpretation:** A free particle with a definite momentum $p=\hbar k$ is described by $\psi(x) \propto e^{ikx}$ (up to normalization), which means the probability density $|\psi|^2$ is uniform in space – the particle is equally likely to be found anywhere (completely delocalized). In reality, we deal with wave packets: a superposition of such plane waves, which can be localized and then move in space. But the plane wave solutions are useful as momentum eigenstates and for scattering calculations. Since $[ \hat{p}, \hat{H} ]=0$ for the free particle, one can label the free states by momentum $p$ as well as energy $E=p^2/(2m)$. Each momentum $p$ (positive or negative) corresponds to a distinct solution. 

**Solving Free Particle Problems:** There is not much to “solve” in the sense of finding discrete eigenvalues, since energies are free. However, tasks might include expressing a given initial wavefunction as a combination of free-particle eigenstates, or computing probability current, etc. The general steps:

1. **Write $V(x)=0$ and Schrödinger’s equation:** $\psi''(x) + k^2 \psi(x) = 0$, with $k=\sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$. 
2. **Write the general solution:** $\psi(x) = A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx}$. If the problem specifies a particle with definite momentum traveling in one direction, you choose either the $e^{ikx}$ term (for a particle moving to the right, i.e. momentum $+p$) or the $e^{-ikx}$ term (moving left). If both terms are present, it can represent a standing wave or a superposition of two momentum states. 
3. **Normalization / interpretation:** If in a finite region (like between reflecting walls), apply boundary conditions (leading to quantization). If truly free (infinite domain), either impose periodic boundary conditions in a large box of length $L$ (so $k$ becomes discrete $2\pi n/L$ temporarily for calculation, then let $L \to \infty$), or use delta-normalization $\langle \psi_{k'} | \psi_k \rangle = \delta(k-k')$. In exam settings, often a wave packet perspective is taken: e.g. a Gaussian wave packet and one may calculate how it spreads in free time evolution. 
4. **Calculate observables:** For a plane wave $Ae^{ikx}$, the probability current can be found $J = \frac{\hbar k}{m}|A|^2$ (this indicates a constant flow of probability density to the right). The expectation value of momentum is $+p=\hbar k$ for that state. If the problem gave an initial wavefunction $\psi(x,0)$ and asks for $\psi(x,t)$ under free evolution, one would use the free particle propagator or Fourier transform methods (since each $k$ component picks up a phase $e^{-i\omega t}$ with $\omega = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}$). 

**Example (Free Particle):** Suppose we have a free electron with a well-defined momentum $p = 5\times10^{-25}$ kg·m/s (about $5\times10^{-3}$ eV/c in energy terms). The corresponding wavefunction can be written as $\psi(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L}} e^{i(kx - \omega t)}$ if we imagine a normalization in a box of length $L$ (later $L\to \infty$). Here $k = p/\hbar \approx 4.76\times10^{9}$ m$^{-1}$ and $E = p^2/(2m) \approx 1.4\times10^{-19}$ J ($\sim0.9$ eV). This state has $\langle p \rangle = p$ and $\langle E \rangle = E$. If we wanted a localized free particle, we could build a wave packet: for example, a Gaussian momentum distribution centered at that $p$ would produce a Gaussian spatial wave packet that moves in time. On an exam, you might be asked something like: “Write down the general solution of the free-particle Schrödinger equation and discuss why an energy eigenstate cannot be normalized in the usual sense.” The answer would involve stating $\psi(x)=Ae^{ikx}$ and explaining that $|\psi|^2$ is constant so it’s non-normalizable over infinite $x$, hence one uses a delta-function normalization or wave packets:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}. Another common exercise: “Show that for a free particle, any $E>0$ is allowed and the dispersion relation is $E = p^2/(2m)$ is the same as the classical one.” We see indeed that $E=\hbar^2 k^2/(2m)$ for the quantum solution, which is equivalent to $p=\hbar k$ and $E=p^2/(2m)$ – same functional relation as a classical particle (no quantization because no potential to impose boundary conditions). 

In summary, the free particle model solidifies understanding of continuous spectra and plane-wave solutions. It also serves as a reference for scattering calculations (e.g. how an incoming plane wave is modified by a potential, compared to the free case). It’s “simple” in that the equation is easy to solve, but subtle in interpretation due to normalization issues.

## Harmonic Oscillator

**Concept and Setup:** The harmonic oscillator model is **a particle in a quadratic potential**: $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2$. This is the quantum analogue of a mass on a spring or small oscillations about a stable equilibrium. Unlike the previous models with piecewise constant potentials, the harmonic oscillator’s potential is smooth and unbounded as $|x|\to\infty$ (it goes to $+\infty$ for large $|x|$). This means the particle is always bound (it cannot escape to infinity because $V(x)\to\infty$ acts like confining walls at infinity), and it has an **infinite discrete spectrum** of energy levels. The harmonic oscillator is extremely important: near any stable equilibrium, a potential can often be approximated by a quadratic form (by Taylor expansion), so the harmonic oscillator is a universal model for small vibrations (molecules, lattice vibrations, quantum fields, etc.). It’s also one of the few systems (like the infinite well) that can be solved analytically, yielding simple expressions for energy and wavefunctions.

**Energy Quantization and Wavefunctions:** The time-independent Schrödinger equation is

$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2\,\psi(x) = E\,\psi(x).$$ 

Solving this differential equation requires more advanced techniques (power series or algebraic operator methods). The boundary conditions are that $\psi(x)$ remains finite as $x\to\pm\infty$ (and $\psi\to 0$ as $x\to\pm\infty$ sufficiently fast to be normalizable). The qualitative behavior: for large $|x|$, the $V(x)$ term dominates and the equation reduces to $\psi'' \sim \frac{m^2\omega^2}{\hbar^2}x^2\psi$, whose solutions must decay Gaussianly to be normalizable. Near $x=0$, the potential is small and solutions behave like free-particle oscillatory. The standard method is to define a dimensionless variable $\xi = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}}\,x$ and attempt a power series $\psi(\xi) = e^{-\xi^2/2} H(\xi)$, where the Gaussian factor $e^{-\xi^2/2}$ is inserted to ensure the correct asymptotic decay and $H(\xi)$ is expanded as a power series (which turns out to be Hermite polynomials when truncated). The requirement that $\psi$ not diverge as $x\to\infty$ forces the power series to terminate, which only happens for certain discrete $E$. The result is a **ladder** of evenly spaced energy eigenvalues: 

$$E_n = \hbar\omega\Big(n + \frac{1}{2}\Big), \qquad n = 0,1,2,3,\dots,$$ 

where $n$ is an integer quantum number (here starting at 0):contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}. So the ground state energy is $E_0=\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$, the first excited $E_1=\frac{3}{2}\hbar\omega$, then $5/2\hbar\omega$, etc. This **equal spacing** $\Delta E = \hbar\omega$ is a unique hallmark of the harmonic oscillator – unlike the infinite well or hydrogen atom, where level spacings get smaller for higher levels, in the oscillator the gap is constant. The presence of the $\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$ zero-point energy again reflects that the particle cannot have zero kinetic energy because if $E=0$, $\psi$ would be zero everywhere (not allowed by normalization). Indeed, even in the lowest state the particle has some “vibrational” energy $\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$.

The eigenfunctions $\psi_n(x)$ turn out to be related to Hermite polynomials $H_n(\xi)$ times a Gaussian. Specifically, 

$$\psi_n(x) = N_n\, e^{-\frac{m\omega x^2}{2\hbar}} H_n\!\Big(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}}\,x\Big),$$ 

where $H_n$ is the Hermite polynomial of degree $n$, and $N_n$ is a normalization constant (e.g. $N_0 = (\frac{m\omega}{\pi\hbar})^{1/4}$ for the ground state). These $\psi_n(x)$ are alternately even and odd functions (reflecting the parity symmetry of the potential): $n$ even gives an even polynomial times the even Gaussian (overall even $\psi$), $n$ odd gives an odd $\psi$. The ground state $\psi_0(x)$ is a Gaussian centered at $x=0$. Higher states oscillate, with $n$th state having $n$ nodes (each node is a sign change). Notably, for large $n$, the wavefunctions spread out further (the “classical turning points” where $E_n = V(x)$ are at $x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2E_n}{m\omega^2}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2\hbar\omega (n+1/2)}{m\omega^2}}$, which grows as $\sim \sqrt{2n}\,(\hbar/(m\omega))^{1/2}$). The probability density $|\psi_n(x)|^2$ for large $n$ oscillates but is enveloped by a broad shape that peaks near the classical turning points – illustrating the correspondence principle (for large quantum numbers, the quantum distribution mimics the classical distribution of an oscillator, which spends more time near turning points). 

**Step-by-Step Approach (Ladder Operator or Series):** There are two common methods to derive the above results:

- *Power Series Method:* Assume $\psi(x) = e^{-\frac{m\omega x^2}{2\hbar}} \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j x^j$. Plug into Schrödinger’s equation, derive a recursion for $a_j$. Termination of the series occurs only if $E$ takes the form $(n+\tfrac{1}{2})\hbar\omega$, which makes the series truncate at $j=n$. This yields polynomial solutions $H_n(x)$. This method, while laborious, is a straightforward differential equation approach.
- *Operator (Algebraic) Method:* Define creation (raising) and annihilation (lowering) operators $a^\dagger$ and $a$ in terms of $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$: $a = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}}(\hat{x} + \frac{i}{m\omega}\hat{p})$. The Hamiltonian can be written as $H = \hbar\omega(a^\dagger a + 1/2)$. Then one can argue that $a^\dagger a$ has eigenvalues $n=0,1,2,\dots$ and thus derive $E_n = \hbar\omega(n+1/2)$. The eigenstates $|n\rangle$ are obtained by repeated application of $a^\dagger$ on the ground state $|0\rangle$ (which satisfies $a|0\rangle=0$). The position-space wavefunctions come out as above. This method is elegant and commonly taught (Griffiths covers it in a later chapter on formalism).

From a practical standpoint, most exam problems on the harmonic oscillator will use known results rather than deriving from scratch (since derivation is lengthy). Typical tasks: **using** the known wavefunctions to calculate expectation values, or verifying properties like $\Delta x \Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2}$ for the ground state, etc. Another common exercise is to approximate a complicated potential near a minimum by a quadratic and identify the effective $\omega$, then state the approximate energy levels. 

**Example (Harmonic Oscillator):** Consider a mass $m$ attached to a spring with classical frequency $\omega = 2\pi(1~\text{THz})$ (terahertz order, typical of molecular vibrations). The ground state energy is $E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$. Plugging numbers: $\hbar\omega = 6.582\times10^{-16}$ eV·s $\times$ $2\pi \times 10^{12}$ s$^{-1} \approx 4.14$ meV. So $E_0 \approx 2.07$ meV. The first excited state is $E_1 = 3*2.07 = 6.21$ meV, and so on (linear spacing). The ground wavefunction is $\psi_0(x) = (m\omega/\pi\hbar)^{1/4} e^{-m\omega x^2/(2\hbar)}$, which for (say) an electron ($m_e$) and the given $\omega$ has a characteristic width $\Delta x \sim \sqrt{\hbar/(m\omega)}$. If $m$ were the proton mass and $\omega$ appropriate for a diatomic bond vibration, one could compute similar values. For large $n$, say $n=10$, $E_{10} = (10.5)\hbar\omega \approx 21.7$ meV in our example, and $\psi_{10}(x)$ would have 10 nodes. The probability density $|\psi_{10}(x)|^2$ oscillates, but if averaged, it tends to be higher near the turning points $x \approx \pm \sqrt{2E_{10}/(m\omega^2)}$. This matches the classical expectation that an oscillator spends more time near the extremes of its motion (where it is slowest). 

From a problem-solving angle, one might be asked to show that $E_n=(n+1/2)\hbar\omega$ are solutions, or to apply the ladder operators: e.g. using $a$ and $a^\dagger$ to find $\langle x \rangle$, $\langle x^2 \rangle$ for the ground state, etc. Another common exercise: verify the **uncertainty product** in the ground state. For $\psi_0(x)$, one can calculate $\langle x^2\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}$ and $\langle p^2\rangle = \frac{m\hbar\omega}{2}$, yielding $\Delta x = \sqrt{\langle x^2\rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}$ and $\Delta p = \sqrt{\langle p^2\rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{m\hbar\omega}{2}}$. Then $\Delta x\,\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2}$, which indeed is the minimum uncertainty allowed by Heisenberg’s principle (the ground state of the harmonic oscillator is a minimum uncertainty state). This kind of result underscores the fundamental nature of the harmonic oscillator’s ground state.

:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30} *Quantum harmonic oscillator potential $V(x)=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2$ (orange parabola) and the first five energy levels (red dashed lines). The energy levels are equally spaced by $\hbar\omega$. The ground state $E_0=\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$ lies above the minimum of the potential. Higher wavefunctions $\psi_n(x)$ oscillate within the “classically allowed” region (where $E_n > V(x)$) and decay in the classically forbidden outside this region. Parity alternates with $n$: $E_1$ has an odd eigenfunction, $E_2$ even, etc. Equally spaced levels are a unique signature of the harmonic oscillator.* 

In summary, the harmonic oscillator stands apart from the square well models: its potential is continuous and unbounded, leading to an infinite ladder of quantized energies with constant spacing. Mastering this model involves familiarity with Hermite polynomials or the operator method, and understanding the properties of the oscillator states (e.g., spacing, parity, Gaussian envelopes). It is a favorite in exams for calculating expectation values and illustrating foundational principles like zero-point motion and minimum uncertainty.

**Conclusion:** The models covered – infinite well, finite well (with its limiting cases of delta potential and free particle), and the harmonic oscillator – form a toolkit of exactly solvable systems. They highlight how the Schrödinger equation is solved under different boundary conditions and potentials. The infinite and finite wells teach about quantization due to boundary conditions and tunneling; the delta potential provides insight into scattering and bound states in a highly localized potential; the free particle reinforces the concept of continuous spectra and plane waves; and the harmonic oscillator, with its equal spacing and polynomial solutions, is a cornerstone for understanding vibrational motion in quantum systems. These models are not only theoretically important but also practically useful approximations in many physical situations. Being comfortable with the step-by-step solution procedures and the qualitative features of each model is essential for exam preparedness and for deeper studies in quantum mechanics.
