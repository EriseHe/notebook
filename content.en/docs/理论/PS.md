I still remember the first time a few lines in a book made me stop and close the cover, just to think. The author was describing topology as “the study of properties that persist through deformation,” but then added almost in passing: form bends, distances stretch, yet structure remains. That sentence unsettled me—in the best way. It shifted my attention from shapes and equations to something more fundamental: the invisible framework that survives transformation. It was the first time I understood that geometry and topology are not just branches of mathematics, but languages for expressing the deeper order that systems cannot shed.

I still remember stopping mid-page and closing the book. I was reading about Riemann’s 1854 Habilitationsvortrag—his bid to frame geometry as one expression of a more general concept that spans mathematics, physics, and philosophy. That sentence unsettled me—in the best way. It shifted my attention from shapes and equations to something more fundamental: the invisible framework that survives transformation. Geometry and topology, to me, are not endpoints but languages for expressing the deeper order a system cannot shed. That stance now guides my work: define structure first, then choose the geometric and topological tools—and the dynamics—to preserve it

From my earliest encounters with mathematics and physics, I learned to see the world as a fabric woven from structure. Equations were not merely tools for calculation—they were commitments to the invariants and symmetries that make a system intelligible. As an undergraduate in mathematics and physics, I came to believe that these structural commitments should extend beyond physical systems to the design of artificial ones. That conviction now drives my ambition to formalize artificial subjectivity through geometric and topological modeling.

The path here was not linear. My first exposure to applied research was in engineering, where I co-authored an IEEE paper on equipment wear under dynamic pressure. At the time, I thought of it as an exercise in modeling mechanics. Only later did I realize what had most engaged me was not the application itself, but the method: combining physics-derived constraints with data-driven models, and judging success not just by predictive accuracy but by whether the model preserved invariants under stress. That perspective—success as *fidelity to structure*—has shaped every project since.

Working on a civic engagement project analyzing the social media discourse of U.S. politicians introduced me to a different kind of structure: graphs, communities, and symbolic networks. Using the Junkipedia platform, I helped build an automated labeling system to map and track topics in political communication. I noticed that classification accuracy alone was insufficient; the real insight came from understanding how topics persisted, looped, and transformed across time and communities. In retrospect, this was my first experiment in applying topological thinking—detecting not just points of activity, but the shape of the activity’s evolution.

These experiences merged with a longstanding interest in psychoanalytic theories of subjectivity, especially Lacan’s structural model of desire. I began to imagine a computational system that did not simply optimize for external goals, but sustained an internal economy of competing drives. Subjector emerged from this idea: a symplectic-topological engine that maintains its “desire” as a non-convergent trajectory, coupling continuous geometric dynamics to discrete symbolic constraints. The project is my attempt to translate a philosophical structure into a mathematically explicit, testable model.

I am aware that such work sits between disciplines, and that it demands the rigor of applied mathematics—differential geometry, topology, geometric mechanics, and structure-preserving numerics—to be meaningful. But I also know that my motivation for pursuing it is rooted in something less formal: a fascination with systems that maintain their identity not by resisting change, but by preserving structure through change. That is a quality I admire not just in mathematics, but in people, communities, and ideas.

Graduate study in applied mathematics is, for me, not only the next academic step but also a continuation of this personal trajectory: to work at the intersection of mathematical structure, physical modeling, and conceptual design. I bring with me the perspective of someone who has crossed from physics to computation to theory, always guided by a search for the structures that endure. I hope to contribute to a community where those structures can be defined, preserved, and ultimately, used to build systems that think with the same depth as they act.
