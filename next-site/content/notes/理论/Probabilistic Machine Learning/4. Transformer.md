## Autoregressive Models
Autoregressive models factorize the joint distribution into conditionals and can be implemented in several ways:

| Model Type          | Example Architectures               | Parallel Training | Parameter Sharing |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Recurrent**       | RNN, LSTM                           | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes           |
| **Masked MLP**      | MADE (Masked Autoencoder for Dist.) | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No            |
| **Masked CNN / Transformer** | PixelCNN, Transformer, Linear Attention | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

- **Parallel training:** Can multiple time steps be computed at once?  
- **Parameter sharing:** Do different positions reuse the same parameters?
