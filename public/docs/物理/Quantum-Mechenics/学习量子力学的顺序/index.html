  Standard Quantum Models: Infinite Well, Finite Well, Delta Potential, Free Particle, and Harmonic Oscillator
  #

Introduction: Chapter 2 of Griffiths’ Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (3rd Ed.) introduces several fundamental one-dimensional quantum models. These include the infinite square well (an idealized particle-in-a-box), the finite square well (a box with finite walls allowing tunneling), the delta-function potential (an extremely narrow attractive well), the free particle (no potential at all), and the harmonic oscillator (a particle in a parabolic potential). These models build on one another logically. We begin with the infinite well as a baseline, then generalize to finite wells. In the limit of a very narrow deep finite well we obtain the delta-function potential, and if we remove the confining walls we recover the free particle as a special case. Finally, we discuss the harmonic oscillator as a separate class of smoothly varying potential. Each section below provides a conceptual explanation, the physical setup and assumptions, key equations with boundary conditions, a step-by-step problem-solving workflow, and a standard example with results. The notation follows Griffiths’ textbook conventions for consistency. By studying these models, one gains practical problem-solving skills and exam readiness in solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation for various potentials."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="https://erisehe.github.io/notebook/docs/%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86/Quantum-Mechenics/%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E9%87%8F%E5%AD%90%E5%8A%9B%E5%AD%A6%E7%9A%84%E9%A1%BA%E5%BA%8F/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="学习笔记"><meta property="og:title" content="学习笔记"><meta property="og:description" content="Standard Quantum Models: Infinite Well, Finite Well, Delta Potential, Free Particle, and Harmonic Oscillator # Introduction: Chapter 2 of Griffiths’ Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (3rd Ed.) introduces several fundamental one-dimensional quantum models.
