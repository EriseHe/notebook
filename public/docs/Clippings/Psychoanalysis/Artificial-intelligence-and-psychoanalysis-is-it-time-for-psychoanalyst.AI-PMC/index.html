In this context, we observe how some of these AIs are spontaneously used by individuals as confidants, and even as romantic partners. The emergence of such relationships with AIs raises questions about their integration in psychiatry and the possibility of developing “digital therapists”. In this regard, we highlight four key elements (accessibility and availability; confidentiality; knowledge; memory) to compare what an AI offers in comparison to a human therapist. We also discuss the results of the studies that have already investigated the use of such AIs in psychotherapy, particularly in the fields of depression and anxiety. We then propose to reflect more specifically on the possibility of creating a “psychoanalyst.AI,” which leads us to examine the elements of the therapeutic relationship (transference, free association, play, dreams, reflexivity, and narrativity) with an AI. In conclusion, we offer some reflections on the relevance of considering AIs as “therapeutic artifact,” while taking into account the ethical issues raised by the use of AIs in therapeutic settings.'>The current development of artificial intelligences (AI) is leading to major transformations within society.

Algorithms, computers, Internet and smartphones are profoundly transforming human societies and subjectivities. In this context, AI is generating a revolution on a massive scale, the consequences of which we are still struggling to measure. For example, some experts at the <em>World Economic Forum</em> estimate that by 2027, around a quarter of all jobs will have been transformed by AI. This revolution will also grow as AI advances will be coupled with robotics, leading the progressive automation of a large number of tasks. These technological evolutions are characterized by their speed of development, to the point where it is even difficult for specialists to keep up with the latest advances in this field of research. Nevertheless, it seems important that clinicians keep abreast of the developments of IA, whether for the purpose of understanding the experience of their patients with these technologies or in the context of their use of Ais in clinical practice.

However, we need to be more precise about the specifics of this narrative work with an AI given that it cannot feel and understand what “meaning” is, it can only handle symbols and probabilities. Thus, an AI could be limited in its interpretations and “narrative capacities” by information processing that is not rooted in body and affects, as well as the impossibility of accessing certain contextual elements (e.g., non-verbal language) that do not appear in the patient’s discourse. Furthermore, the analyst offers interpretations rooted in their own subjective experience, especially within the transferential dynamic, which would further limit the complexity and depth of the interpretations an AI can generate.</p><p data-raw='These different elements are always intertwined during psychoanalysis and it might seem artificial to distinguish them in this way, but thinking about a possible “psychoanalyst.AI” invites to a better description of the analytical process. We might then wonder to what extent an AI incorporating such principles might be able to support the development of symbolization processes. Such a process is classically considered in analysis as being the fruit of an encounter “with another”, with the analytic space aiming to catalyze such an intersubjective process.
