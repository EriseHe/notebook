## 4.3.1 量子数 (Quantum Numbers)

The stationary states of the hydrogen atom are labeled by three quantum numbers: $n$, $\ell$, and $m$. The principal quantum number ($n$) determines the energy of the state, while $\ell$ and $m$ are related to the orbital angular momentum. In classical physics, energy and angular momentum are fundamental conserved quantities, so it's not surprising that angular momentum plays an important role in quantum theory as well.

## 4.3.2 经典角动量 (Classical Angular Momentum)

Classically, the angular momentum of a particle (with respect to the origin) is given by:

$$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}$$

In component form, this gives us:

$$L_x = yp_z - zp_y, \quad L_y = zp_x - xp_z, \quad L_z = xp_y - yp_x$$

## 4.3.3 量子算符 (Quantum Operators)

In quantum mechanics, we obtain the corresponding operators by the standard prescription:

$$p_x \rightarrow -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \quad p_y \rightarrow -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \quad p_z \rightarrow -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$$

Now we'll explore the eigenvalues of the angular momentum operators through algebraic techniques based on commutation relations.

## 4.3.4 本征值 (Eigenvalues)

### 交换关系 (Commutation Relations)

The operators $L_x$ and $L_y$ do not commute. Let's calculate their commutator:

$$[L_x, L_y] = [yp_z - zp_y, zp_x - xp_z]$$

Expanding this:
$$[L_x, L_y] = [yp_z, zp_x] - [yp_z, xp_z] - [zp_y, zp_x] + [zp_y, xp_z]$$

From canonical commutation relations, we know that only $x$ with $p_x$, $y$ with $p_y$, and $z$ with $p_z$ fail to commute. So the two middle terms drop out:

$$[L_x, L_y] = yp_z[z, p_x] + xp_z[z, p_y] = i\hbar(xp_y - yp_x) = i\hbar L_z$$

By cyclic permutation of indices, we can obtain the other commutation relations:

$$[L_x, L_y] = i\hbar L_z; \quad [L_y, L_z] = i\hbar L_x; \quad [L_z, L_x] = i\hbar L_y$$

These are the fundamental commutation relations for angular momentum; everything follows from them.

### 不相容的可观测量 (Incompatible Observables)

Notice that $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$ are incompatible observables. According to the generalized uncertainty principle:

$$\sigma_{L_x}\sigma_{L_y} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}|\langle L_z \rangle|$$

This means it would be futile to look for states that are simultaneously eigenfunctions of $L_x$ and $L_y$. However, the square of the total angular momentum:

$$L^2 = L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2$$

does commute with all components of $\mathbf{L}$:

$$[L^2, L_x] = [L_x^2, L_x] + [L_y^2, L_x] + [L_z^2, L_x] = 0$$

$$[L^2, L_y] = 0, \quad [L^2, L_z] = 0$$

Or more compactly:

$$[L^2, \mathbf{L}] = 0$$

So we can hope to find simultaneous eigenstates of $L^2$ and (say) $L_z$:

$$L^2 f = \lambda f \quad \text{and} \quad L_z f = \mu f$$

## 4.3.5 阶梯算符 (Ladder Operators)

We'll use the ladder operator technique, similar to the harmonic oscillator treatment. Define:

$$L_{\pm} = L_x \pm iL_y$$

The commutator with $L_z$ is:

$$[L_z, L_{\pm}] = [L_z, L_x] \pm i[L_z, L_y] = i\hbar L_y \pm i(-i\hbar L_x) = \pm\hbar(L_x \pm iL_y) = \pm\hbar L_{\pm}$$

So:
$$[L_z, L_{\pm}] = \pm\hbar L_{\pm}$$

Also:
$$[L^2, L_{\pm}] = 0$$

If $f$ is an eigenfunction of $L^2$ and $L_z$, so is $L_{\pm}f$:

$$L^2(L_{\pm}f) = L_{\pm}(L^2f) = L_{\pm}(\lambda f) = \lambda(L_{\pm}f)$$

$$L_z(L_{\pm}f) = (L_zL_{\pm} - L_{\pm}L_z + L_{\pm}L_z)f = (\pm\hbar L_{\pm} + L_{\pm}L_z)f = (\mu \pm \hbar)(L_{\pm}f)$$

So $L_{\pm}f$ is an eigenfunction of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $\mu \pm \hbar$. We call $L_+$ the raising operator (increases eigenvalue by $\hbar$) and $L_-$ the lowering operator (decreases eigenvalue by $\hbar$).

For a given $\lambda$, we get a "ladder" of states with each "rung" separated by $\hbar$ in the eigenvalue of $L_z$. But this process must end somewhere. There must be a "top rung" $f_t$ such that:

$$L_+f_t = 0$$

Let $\hbar\ell$ be the eigenvalue of $L_z$ at the top rung:

$$L_zf_t = \hbar\ell f_t; \quad L^2f_t = \lambda f_t$$

Now:

$$L_{\pm}L_{\mp} = (L_x \pm iL_y)(L_x \mp iL_y) = L_x^2 + L_y^2 \mp i(L_xL_y - L_yL_x) = L^2 - L_z^2 \mp i\hbar L_z$$

So:
$$L^2 = L_+L_- + L_z^2 + \hbar L_z$$

This gives:
$$L^2f_t = (L_-L_+ + L_z^2 - \hbar L_z)f_t = (0 + \hbar^2\ell^2 - \hbar^2\ell)f_t = \hbar^2\ell(\ell - 1)f_t$$

And:
$$\lambda = \hbar^2\ell(\ell - 1)$$

Similarly, there must be a "bottom rung" $f_b$ such that:

$$L_-f_b = 0$$

With:
$$L_zf_b = \hbar\tilde{\ell}f_b; \quad L^2f_b = \lambda f_b$$

This leads to:
$$\lambda = \hbar^2\tilde{\ell}(\tilde{\ell} + 1)$$

Comparing these equations for $\lambda$, we find that $\ell(\ell - 1) = \tilde{\ell}(\tilde{\ell} + 1)$, which means either $\tilde{\ell} = \ell + 1$ (absurd—the bottom rung would be higher than the top rung!) or:

$$\tilde{\ell} = -\ell$$

Thus, the eigenvalues of $L_z$ are $m\hbar$, where $m$ goes from $-\ell$ to $+\ell$ in integer steps. In particular, $\ell = -\tilde{\ell} + N$, and thus $\ell = N/2$, which means $\ell$ must be an integer or a half-integer.

The eigenfunctions are characterized by the numbers $\ell$ and $m$:

$$L^2f_\ell^m = \hbar^2\ell(\ell + 1)f_\ell^m; \quad L_zf_\ell^m = \hbar mf_\ell^m$$

where:
$$\ell = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, \ldots; \quad m = -\ell, -\ell + 1, \ldots, \ell - 1, \ell$$

For a given value of $\ell$, there are $2\ell + 1$ different values of $m$ (i.e., $2\ell + 1$ "rungs" on the "ladder").

## 4.3.6 角动量的球坐标表示 (Angular Momentum in Spherical Coordinates)

To determine the eigenfunctions $f_\ell^m(\theta, \phi)$, we need to express the angular momentum operators in spherical coordinates.

First, we rewrite $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$ in spherical coordinates:

$$L_z = -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}$$

$$L_x = -i\hbar\left(-\sin\phi\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} - \cos\phi\cot\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}\right)$$

$$L_y = -i\hbar\left(\cos\phi\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} - \sin\phi\cot\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}\right)$$

The raising and lowering operators become:

$$L_{\pm} = \pm\hbar e^{\pm i\phi}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} \pm i\cot\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}\right)$$

And $L^2$ takes the form:

$$L^2 = -\hbar^2\left[\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\right) + \frac{1}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\phi^2}\right]$$

## 4.3.7 球谐函数 (Spherical Harmonics)

Now we can determine $f_\ell^m(\theta, \phi)$. It's an eigenfunction of $L^2$ with eigenvalue $\hbar^2\ell(\ell + 1)$:

$$L^2f_\ell^m = -\hbar^2\left[\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\right) + \frac{1}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\phi^2}\right]f_\ell^m = \hbar^2\ell(\ell + 1)f_\ell^m$$

It's also an eigenfunction of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\hbar$:

$$L_zf_\ell^m = -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}f_\ell^m = \hbar mf_\ell^m$$

This is equivalent to the azimuthal equation. We have already solved this system of equations! The result (appropriately normalized) is the spherical harmonic:

$$f_\ell^m(\theta, \phi) = Y_\ell^m(\theta, \phi)$$

**Conclusion**: Spherical harmonics are the eigenfunctions of $L^2$ and $L_z$. When we solved the Schrödinger equation by separation of variables, we were inadvertently constructing simultaneous eigenfunctions of the three commuting operators $H$, $L^2$, and $L_z$:

$$H\psi = E\psi, \quad L^2\psi = \hbar^2\ell(\ell + 1)\psi, \quad L_z\psi = \hbar m\psi$$

This explains why the spherical harmonics are orthogonal: they are eigenfunctions of hermitian operators ($L^2$ and $L_z$) belonging to distinct eigenvalues.

## **重要结论 (Key Conclusions)**

1. Angular momentum operators satisfy the fundamental commutation relations: $[L_i, L_j] = i\hbar\epsilon_{ijk}L_k$

2. While the individual components $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$ do not commute with each other, $L^2$ commutes with all components.

3. The eigenvalues of $L^2$ are $\hbar^2\ell(\ell+1)$ where $\ell$ can be integer or half-integer.

4. For each value of $\ell$, the eigenvalues of $L_z$ are $\hbar m$ where $m$ ranges from $-\ell$ to $+\ell$ in integer steps.

5. For a given $\ell$, there are $2\ell+1$ different values of $m$.

6. The eigenfunctions of $L^2$ and $L_z$ are the spherical harmonics $Y_\ell^m(\theta,\phi)$.

7. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum cannot point in a definite direction; when $L_z$ has a well-defined value, $L_x$ and $L_y$ do not.
