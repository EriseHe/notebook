To find a particle's wave function, $\psi(x,t)$, we solve:
>logically analogous to **Newton's Second Law** $F=ma$

> [!definition] Schrodinger's Equation
> $$i\hbar \frac{ \partial \Psi}{ \partial t}=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{ \partial^{2}\Psi}{ \partial x^{2} }+V \Psi$$

where **Planck's constant** $\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}=1.054573 \times 10^{-34}$.


> [!definition] Born's Statistical Interpretation
>$$\int^{a}_{b} |\Psi(x,t)^{2}| \, dx $$
which is the probability finding the particle between $a$ and $b$.

>It is natural to wonder whether it is a fact of nature, or a defect in theory.

### Three quantum indeterminacy position:
1. realist
	- the particle was at C. (a hidden variable?)
2. orthodox (Copenhagen Interpretation)
	- the particle wasn't anywhere. (measurement *produce* the result)
	- most widely accepted position
3. (agnosticism) 
	- *refuse to answer.* That is, no meaning to ask such question.
	> Pauli: one should no more rack one's brain about the problem of whether something one cannot know anything about exists all the same, than about the ancient question of how many angels are able to sit on the point of needle.
	- fall-back position, however, eliminated by John Bell's experiment in 1964

### Two Distinct Physical Processes:
1. Ordinary
	- evolves in a leisurely fashion under
2. Measurements
	- wave equation $\Psi$ discontinuously **collapses**, when the first measurement radically alters the function.
