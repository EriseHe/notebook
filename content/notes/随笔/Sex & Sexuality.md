### Can you imagine sexuality without gender?

For Foucault

Sexual identity i s produced within the grid of sexuality
- from normal to abnormal
- changes over time

	Modern subject is a sexual subject (gendered being)

What does freedom look like in this?
When there is no *outside*, what does it mean to have transgression?

 - greatest pleasure is the pleasure of the analysis

(It is apparent that the deployment of sexuality, with its differ­ ent strategies, was what established this notion of "sex"; and in the four major forms of hysteria, onanism, fetishism, and interrupted coition, it showed this sex to be governed by the interplay of whole and part, principle and lack, absence and presence, excess and deficiency, by the function of instinct, finality, and meaning, of reality and pleasure.)

Sexuality is not a drive, but a grid. That creates a speculative relationship

p.156

(Hence the fact that over the centuries it has become more important than our soul, more important al­ most than our life; and so it is that all the world's enigmas appear frivolous to us compared to this secret, minuscule in each of us, but of a density that makes it more serious than any other.)

p.156

(we have arrived at the point where we expect our intelligibility to come from what was for many centuries thought of as madness; the plenitude of our body from what was long considered its stigma and likened to a wound)

Sovereign Power
**"law"**
law always referes to the sword - always taking lifes

Regulatory (bio-power)
- the rule fucntions as **"norms"**
- the displayment 
- it looks like it is more humane, but it may not be so:
- it becomes continuous, corrective
- distribution of the living
- continious apparatucy  


	foucault is like boxer, punching at whenever, and whatever is needed

**Reistance?**
for Sovereign Power: revolution
for Regulatory Power: breaking the continuity, some sort of rupture of such continuity.



as long as we are trapped in illusion of choice, and agency, there is no way of resistance! Free thoughts of what is silencely thought, and hence free outself.

Foucault: rejects S-O

The relation to others, and relation to the time:
	freedom is the practice of the self in relation to others.

Thoughts if a form of action, is the result of problemitization. 

Why is sexuality conduct an object of moral solicitude?
- we governed ourselves through sexuality
- there is a sexual hierarchy (e.g. there is good sexuality and bad sexuality)
