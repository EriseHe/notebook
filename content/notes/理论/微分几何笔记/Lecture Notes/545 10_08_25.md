## Smooth maps and functions

Let \(M\) be a smooth manifold.

A map
\[
f : M \to \mathbb{R}^k
\]
is **smooth** if for every coordinate chart
\[
x : U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M,
\]
the coordinate representation
\[
f \circ x : U \to \mathbb{R}^k
\]
is a \(C^\infty\) map in the usual sense.

The space of smooth real‑valued functions on \(M\) is
\[
C^\infty(M) = \{ f : M \to \mathbb{R} \mid f \text{ is smooth} \}.
\]

Smoothness for maps between manifolds is defined in the same way, in local coordinates.

## Tangent vectors

**Definition (tangent vector).**  
At a point \(p \in M\), a **tangent vector** \(X \in T_pM\) is a directional derivative
\[
X : C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}
\]
satisfying the Leibniz rule
\[
X(fg) = f(p)\,Xg + g(p)\,Xf
\quad\text{for all } f,g \in C^\infty(M).
\]

As in the surface case, \(T_pM\) is an \(n\)-dimensional vector space (where \(n = \dim M\)).

In local coordinates \(x^1,\dots,x^n\), the coordinate basis of \(T_pM\) is
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big|_p, \qquad i=1,\dots,n.
\]

For a smooth curve \(\gamma : I \to M\), the **velocity vector** at \(t\) is the tangent vector
\[
\dot\gamma(t) : C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad
\dot\gamma(t)(f) = \frac{d}{dt}\big(f\circ\gamma\big)(t).
\]

---

## Tangent bundle and vector bundles

The **tangent bundle** of \(M\) is the disjoint union
\[
TM = \bigsqcup_{p\in M} T_pM.
\]

This space carries the structure of a smooth manifold and comes with the natural projection
\[
\pi : TM \to M, \qquad \pi(X_p) = p.
\]

Given a coordinate patch
\[
x : U \to M,
\]
we get an induced chart
\[
\tilde x : U \times \mathbb{R}^n \to TM
\]
defined by
\[
\tilde x(x,v) = v^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big|_{x(x)} \in T_{x(x)}M.
\]
These charts make \(TM\) into a smooth manifold of dimension \(2n\).  
\(TM\) is called the **tangent bundle** of \(M\).

### Vector bundles

**Definition (vector bundle).**  
A **vector bundle** \(E\) of rank \(k\) over \(M\) is a manifold \(E\) together with a smooth map
\[
\pi : E \to M
\]
such that:

1. For each \(p \in M\), the fiber 
   \[
   E_p := \pi^{-1}(p)
   \]
   is a \(k\)-dimensional vector space.
2. For each \(p \in M\), there exists a neighborhood \(V \ni p\) and a diffeomorphism
   \[
   \psi : \pi^{-1}(V) \to V \times \mathbb{R}^k
   \]
   such that \(\mathrm{pr}_1 \circ \psi = \pi\) and for each \(q \in V\), the restriction
   \[
   \psi|_{E_q} : E_q \to \{q\} \times \mathbb{R}^k
   \]
   is a linear isomorphism of vector spaces.

**Definition (section).**  
A **section** of \(E\) is a smooth map
\[
s : M \to E
\]
such that \(s(p) \in E_p\) for every \(p\), equivalently \(\pi \circ s = \operatorname{id}_M\).

A section of \(TM\) is called a **vector field**.

---

## Cotangent vectors and the cotangent bundle

For a finite‑dimensional vector space \(V\), the **dual space** \(V^*\) is the set of linear maps
\[
V^* = \{ \ell : V \to \mathbb{R} \mid \ell \text{ linear} \}.
\]

The **cotangent space** at \(p\) is
\[
T_p^*M := (T_pM)^*.
\]

Given local coordinates \(x^1,\dots,x^n\) near \(p\), we have the coordinate basis
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big|_p
\]
for \(T_pM\), and the dual basis
\[
dx^i \in T_p^*M
\]
defined by
\[
dx^i\Big(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\Big) = \delta^i_j.
\]

This allows us to define coordinate charts for
\[
T^*M = \bigsqcup_{p\in M} T_p^*M,
\]
the **cotangent bundle** of \(M\).

### Differential of a function

For a smooth function \(f \in C^\infty(M)\), the **differential** of \(f\) is the section
\[
df : M \to T^*M
\]
defined pointwise by
\[
(df)_p(X) = Xf, \qquad X \in T_pM.
\]

In local coordinates this corresponds to
\[
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\,dx^i.
\]

## Riemannian metrics

**Definition (Riemannian metric).**  
A **Riemannian metric** on \(M\) is a smooth family of inner products
\[
g_p(\,\cdot\,,\,\cdot\,) : T_pM \times T_pM \to \mathbb{R},
\quad p \in M,
\]
such that for any smooth vector fields \(X,Y\), the function
\[
p \mapsto g_p(X_p,Y_p)
\]
is smooth.

In local coordinates \(x^1,\dots,x^n\), this means
\[
g_{ij}(x) := g\Big(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\Big)
\]
are smooth functions, and the matrix \([g_{ij}(x)]\) is symmetric and positive‑definite at each point.

The metric defines the **length** of a curve \(\gamma : I \to M\) by
\[
L(\gamma) = \int_I \lVert \dot\gamma(t) \rVert\,dt
\]
where, in coordinates,
\[
\lVert \dot\gamma(t) \rVert^2
  = g_{ij}(\gamma(t))\,\dot\gamma^i(t)\,\dot\gamma^j(t).
\]

---

## Raising and lowering indices; gradient

The metric defines an isomorphism
\[
g^\flat_p : T_pM \to T_p^*M, \qquad
g^\flat_p(X) = g_p(X,\,\cdot\,).
\]

In coordinates, the covector corresponding to the basis vector \(\partial_i := \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\) is
\[
g_i := g^\flat(\partial_i) = g_{ij}\,dx^j.
\]

Using the inverse matrix \(g^{ij}\) (defined by \(g^{ij}g_{jk} = \delta^i_k\)), we get the inverse map
\[
g^\sharp_p : T_p^*M \to T_pM.
\]

**Example (gradient).**  
For \(f \in C^\infty(M)\), the **gradient** \(\nabla f\) is defined by
\[
g(\nabla f, X) = df(X) \quad\text{for all } X \in TM.
\]
In local coordinates,
\[
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j}\,dx^j,
\qquad
\nabla f = g^{ij}\,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j}\,\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}.
\]

## Tensors

In linear algebra, the **tensor product** of vector spaces \(V\) and \(W\) is a vector space
\[
V \otimes W
\]
spanned by formal symbols \(v \otimes w\) with bilinearity relations:

1. \((a v) \otimes w = v \otimes (a w) = a (v \otimes w)\) for all \(a \in \mathbb{R}\).
2. \((v_1 + v_2) \otimes w = v_1 \otimes w + v_2 \otimes w\) and  
   \(v \otimes (w_1 + w_2) = v \otimes w_1 + v \otimes w_2\).

One has
\[
\dim(V \otimes W) = (\dim V)(\dim W).
\]

Example: \(V \otimes V^* \cong \{\text{linear maps } V \to V\}\).

Given vector bundles \(E\) and \(F\) over \(M\), we can form the **tensor product bundle**
\[
E \otimes F := \bigsqcup_{p\in M} (E_p \otimes F_p).
\]

**Definition (tensor field).**  
For non‑negative integers \(k,\ell\), the bundle of \((k,\ell)\)-tensors on \(M\) is
\[
T^k_\ell M
  := \underbrace{T^*M \otimes \cdots \otimes T^*M}_{k \text{ times}}
     \otimes
     \underbrace{TM \otimes \cdots \otimes TM}_{\ell \text{ times}}.
\]
A **\((k,\ell)\)-tensor field** on \(M\) is a smooth section of \(T^k_\ell M\).

Example: the Riemannian metric \(g\) is a symmetric \((0,2)\)-tensor field.
