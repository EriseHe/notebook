## 1. Exponential Map

### 1.1 Definition of $\exp$

Fix a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with geodesics as defined previously.

> [!definition|1.1] Exponential map  
> Define the **exponential map**
> $$
> \exp:U\subset TM \longrightarrow M
> $$
> as follows: for $v\in T_pM$,
> $$
> \exp(v)=\gamma_v(1)
> $$
> where $\gamma_v$ is the geodesic with
> $$
> \gamma_v(0)=p,\qquad \dot\gamma_v(0)=v
> $$
> and $v\in U$ precisely when $\gamma_v$ exists at $t=1$.

(So $U$ is the set of tangent vectors for which the corresponding geodesic is defined at time $1$.)

### 1.2 Rescaling lemma and a corollary

> [!lemma|1.2] Rescaling Lemma  
> If $\gamma$ is a geodesic of constant speed $r=\|\dot\gamma\|$, then for any constant $c>0$ the reparametrized curve
> $$
> \eta(t)=\gamma(ct)
> $$
> is a geodesic of speed $cr$.

**Proof.** The chain rule gives
$$
\|\dot\eta\| = \|c\,\dot\gamma\| = c\,\|\dot\gamma\|
$$
so the speed is multiplied by $c$. One checks
$$
\nabla_{\dot\eta}\dot\eta = c^2\,\nabla_{\dot\gamma}\dot\gamma
$$
and since $\gamma$ is a geodesic, $\nabla_{\dot\gamma}\dot\gamma=0$, hence also $\nabla_{\dot\eta}\dot\eta=0$.  

$\square$

> [!corollary|1.3] Geodesic starting at $p$ with velocity $v$  
> For the geodesic $\gamma_v$ with $\gamma_v(0)=p$ and $\dot\gamma_v(0)=v$ we have
> $$
> \gamma_v(t)=\exp(t v)
> $$
> as long as both sides are defined.

### 1.3 Smoothness of $\exp$

> [!proposition|1.4] Domain and smoothness of $\exp$  
> The set $U$ is an open subset of the $0$–section in $TM$, and
> $$
> \exp:U\longrightarrow M
> $$
> is a smooth map.

*Sketch of proof.* This is an application of standard ODE regularity. In local coordinates, geodesics satisfy an ODE system of the form
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot u^j &= f^j(t,u) ,\qquad f^j\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}),\ j=1,\dots,m \\[4pt]
u^j(0) &= a^j ,\qquad j=1,\dots,m
\end{aligned}
$$
The existence–uniqueness theorem for ODEs implies that there is a unique solution $u(t;a)$, and regularity of ODE solutions implies that
$$
u(t;a)
$$
depends smoothly on $(t,a)\in\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$. Translating back to geodesics in $M$ gives that $\exp$ is smooth and defined on an open neighborhood $U$ of the $0$–section.

## 2. Differential of the Exponential Map

### 2.1 The differential $d(\exp_p)$

The term “exponential’’ comes from the behavior of the differential of $\exp$.

For each fixed $p\in M$ we have
$$
\exp_p:T_pM\longrightarrow M,\qquad \exp_p(v):=\exp(v)
$$

Then for $X\in T_pM$,
$$
d(\exp_p)_X: T_X(T_pM)\longrightarrow T_{\exp_p(X)}M
$$
is the differential at $X$.

Since $T_pM$ is a vector space, we canonically identify
$$
T_X(T_pM)\cong T_pM
$$
for every $X\in T_pM$. With this identification, for $V\in T_pM$ we define
$$
d(\exp_p)_X V := \left.\frac{d}{dt}\exp_p(X+tV)\right|_{t=0}
$$

In particular, at $X=0$ we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
d(\exp_p)_0 V
&= \left.\frac{d}{dt}\exp_p(tV)\right|_{t=0} \\[4pt]
&= \dot\gamma_V(0) \\[4pt]
&= V
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\gamma_V$ is the geodesic with initial velocity $V$.

> [!lemma|2.1] Differential at the origin  
> $$
> d(\exp_p)_0 = I
> $$
> i.e. $d(\exp_p)_0$ is the identity map on $T_pM$.

### 2.2 Local diffeomorphism and an example

Recall the inverse function theorem:

> [!theorem|2.2] Inverse function theorem (Euclidean version)  
> Let $f:U_1\to V_1$ be a smooth map between open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  
> If $df(x_0):\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is invertible for some $x_0\in U_1$, then there exist neighborhoods
> $$
> U_0\subset U_1,\qquad V_0\subset V_1
> $$
> such that $f:U_0\to V_0$ is a diffeomorphism.

Applying this to $\exp_p$ and using Lemma 2.1 we obtain:

> [!corollary|2.3] Local diffeomorphism of $\exp_p$  
> For each $p\in M$ there exist neighborhoods
> $$
> U\subset T_pM,\qquad V\subset M
> $$
> such that
> $$
> \exp_p:U\longrightarrow V
> $$
> is a diffeomorphism.

**Example.** Let $S^2$ be the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$.  
Fix a point $p_0\in S^2$. Then
$$
\exp_{p_0}:T_{p_0}S^2\longrightarrow S^2
$$
is a diffeomorphism as long as we do not hit the antipodal point $-p_0$. Concretely,
$$
\exp_{p_0}:\{\,|X|<\pi\,\}\longrightarrow S^2\setminus\{-p_0\}
$$
is a diffeomorphism.

## 3. Geodesic Normal Coordinates

### 3.1 Construction

Choose an orthonormal basis $\{E_j\}$ for $T_pM$.  

Define the coordinate map
$$
\Psi(x^1,\dots,x^n) := \exp_p(x^j E_j)
$$

The image of the set
$$
\{\,|x|<r\,\}
$$
under $\Psi$ is called a **geodesic ball**
$$
B_r(p)\subset M
$$

The radial curves in $B_r(p)$ (i.e. curves of the form $t\mapsto\Psi(t\,x)$) are geodesics by the definition of $\exp_p$.

---

### 3.2 Metric at the center of normal coordinates

> [!proposition|3.1] Metric in geodesic normal coordinates  
> In geodesic normal coordinates centered at $p$, we have
> $$
> g_{ij}\big|_p = \delta_{ij},\qquad
> \partial_k g_{ij}\big|_p = 0
> $$
> (This is a straightforward exercise.)

So at the center $p$, the metric looks Euclidean and has vanishing first derivatives in these coordinates.

---

### 3.3 Uniformly normal neighborhoods

> [!definition|3.2] Uniformly normal neighborhood  
> A neighborhood $W\subset M$ is **uniformly normal** if there exists $S>0$ such that each point of $W$ has a geodesic ball of radius at least $S$.

(Heuristically, the injectivity radius is bounded below by $S$ on $W$; a “straight cylinder’’ picture is uniformly normal, while a cone with the tip included is not.)

> [!lemma|3.3] Existence of uniformly normal neighborhoods  
> Any point $p_0\in M$ admits a uniformly normal neighborhood.

The sketch in the notes: one compares, in normal coordinates around $p_0$, the Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the $g$–norm. This controls how far the exponential map stays a diffeomorphism and yields a uniform lower bound on geodesic ball radii inside a sufficiently small neighborhood of $p_0$.

## 4. Geodesics and Distance

### 4.1 Regular curves and length

A curve $\gamma:I\to M$ is **regular** if
$$
\dot\gamma(t)\neq 0\quad\text{for all }t
$$
(so it admits a unit–speed reparametrization).

For regular curves $\gamma:[a,b]\to M$, define the **length functional**
$$
L(\gamma) := \int_a^b \|\dot\gamma(t)\|\,dt
$$

This definition is easily extended to **piecewise regular** curves, meaning continuous curves that are a finite union of regular segments.

---

### 4.2 Distance induced by geodesics

Given $p,q\in M$, there exists a piecewise regular path from $p$ to $q$ obtained by joining regular paths inside coordinate neighborhoods.

> [!definition|4.1] Riemannian distance  
> Define the distance between $p$ and $q$ by
> $$
> d(p,q) := \inf\{\,L(\gamma) : \gamma \text{ piecewise regular from }p\text{ to }q\,\}
> $$

> [!lemma|4.2] Metric topology from $g$  
> This definition makes $(M,g)$ into a metric space, and the metric topology induced by $d$ agrees with the given manifold topology.

So the Riemannian metric $g$ not only measures lengths of tangent vectors and curves but also induces a genuine distance function compatible with the underlying smooth structure.
