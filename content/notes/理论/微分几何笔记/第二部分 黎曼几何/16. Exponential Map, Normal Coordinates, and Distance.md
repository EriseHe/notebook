## 1. Exponential map

### 1.1 Definition

> [!definition|1.1] Exponential map
> Define the exponential map
> $$
> \exp : U \subset TM \longrightarrow M
> $$
> by
> $$
> v \in T_pM \longmapsto \exp(v) = \gamma_v(1)
> $$
> where $\gamma_v$ is the geodesic with
> $$
> \gamma_v(0) = p, \qquad \dot\gamma_v(0) = v
> $$
> and $v \in U$ if $\gamma_v$ exists at $t=1$.

(Geometrically, $\exp(v)$ is the point reached at time $1$ by the geodesic starting from $p$ with initial velocity $v$.)

### 1.2 Re-scaling lemma for geodesics

> [!lemma|1.2] Re-scaling a constant–speed geodesic
> If $\gamma$ is a geodesic of constant speed
> $$
> r = \|\dot\gamma\|
> $$
> then the curve
> $$
> \eta(t) := \gamma(c t)
> $$
> is a geodesic of speed $c r$.

**Proof sketch.** The chain rule gives
$$
\|\dot \eta\| = c\|\dot\gamma\|
$$
and one checks
$$
\nabla_{\dot \eta}\dot \eta = c^2 \nabla_{\dot\gamma}\dot\gamma
$$
so ${} \nabla_{\dot \eta}\dot \eta = 0 {}$ whenever $\nabla_{\dot\gamma}\dot\gamma = 0$.

### 1.3 Corollary: geodesics as exponentials

From the lemma,

> [!remark|1.3] Corollary
> For a geodesic $\gamma_v$ with initial data $(\gamma_v(0)=p,\dot\gamma_v(0)=v)$,
> $$
> \gamma_v(t) = \exp(t v)
> $$
> as long as both sides are defined.

### 1.4 Openness and smoothness of the domain

> [!proposition|1.4] Openness and smoothness of $\exp$
> $U$ is an open subset of the $0$–section in $TM$, and $\exp$ is a smooth map.

*Idea of proof (ODE regularity).* Consider an ODE system
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot u^j &= f^j(t,u)
\quad\text{where } f^j \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{m+1}),\ j=1,\dots,m \\[4pt]
u^j(0) &= a^j,
\quad j=1,\dots,m
\end{aligned}
$$
which encodes the geodesic equation in local coordinates. By the standard theory of smooth ODEs, there is a unique solution $u(t;a)$, and

$$
\underbrace{u(t;a)}_{\text{solution}}
\quad\text{is smooth as a function of}\quad
\underbrace{(t,a) \in \mathbb{R}^{m+1}}_{\text{initial data and time}}
$$

This gives smooth dependence on initial data and shows that the set of initial velocities $v$ for which the solution exists at $t=1$ is open, i.e. $U$ is open, and that $\exp$ is smooth.

## 2. Differential of the exponential map

Fix $p\in M$ and write $\exp_p : T_pM \to M$.

Since
$$
\exp_p : T_pM \longrightarrow M
$$
its differential at $X\in T_pM$ is a linear map
$$
d(\exp_p)_X : T_X(T_pM) \longrightarrow T_{\exp_p(X)}M
$$

Since $T_pM$ is a vector space, we have a canonical identification
$$
T_X(T_pM) \cong T_pM
$$
for each $X\in T_pM$.

This identification means that for $V\in T_pM$ we can *define*
$$
d(\exp_p)_X V := \left.\frac{d}{dt}\exp_p(X + tV)\right|_{t=0}
$$

### 2.1 Specialization at the origin

In particular,
$$
\begin{aligned}
d(\exp_p)_0 V
&= \left.\frac{d}{dt}\exp_p(tV)\right|_{t=0} \\[4pt]
&= \underbrace{\dot\gamma_V(0)}_{\text{initial velocity of the geodesic with }\dot\gamma_V(0)=V} \\[4pt]
&= V
\end{aligned}
$$

> [!lemma|2.1] Differential at the origin
> $$
> d(\exp_p)_0 = I
> $$
> i.e. $d(\exp_p)_0$ is the identity map on $T_pM$.

### 2.2 Inverse function theorem and local diffeomorphism

> [!theorem|2.2] Inverse function theorem (Euclidean version)
> For $f : U_1 \to V_1$ between open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, if $d f(x) : \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is invertible for some $x\in U_1$, then there exist neighborhoods $U_2\subset U_1$ of $x$ and $V_2\subset V_1$ of $f(x)$ such that
> $$
> f : U_2 \longrightarrow V_2
> $$
> is a diffeomorphism.

Applying this to $\exp_p$ in normal coordinates and using $d(\exp_p)_0 = I$:

> [!proposition|2.3] Local diffeomorphism property of $\exp_p$
> For each $p\in M$ there exist neighborhoods $U \subset T_pM$ and $V \subset M$ such that
> $$
> \exp_p : U \longrightarrow V
> $$
> is a diffeomorphism.

### 2.3 Example: the unit sphere

Let $S^2$ be the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For $p\in S^2$, the map $\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism as long as we do not hit the antipode $-p$. Concretely,
$$
\exp_p : \{\, X \mid |X| < \pi \,\} \longrightarrow S^2 \setminus \{-p\}
$$
## 3. Geodesic normal coordinates and uniformly normal neighborhoods

### 3.1 Geodesic normal coordinates

Choose an orthonormal basis $\{E_j\}$ for $T_pM$.

> [!definition|3.1] Geodesic normal coordinates at $p$
> Define
> $$
> \Psi(x^1,\dots,x^n) = \exp_p(x^j E_j)
> $$

The image of
$$
\{\, |x| < r \,\}
$$
under $\Psi$ is called a **geodesic ball**
$$
B_r(p) \subset M
$$

The radial curves in $B_r(p)$ (curves of the form $t\mapsto \Psi(tx)$) are geodesics by the definition of $\exp_p$.

> [!proposition|3.2] Metric in geodesic normal coordinates
> In geodesic normal coordinates at $p$,
> $$
> g_{ij}\big|_p = \delta_{ij}, 
> \qquad
> \partial_k g_{ij}\big|_p = 0
> $$
> (trivial exercise)

---

### 3.2 Uniformly normal neighborhoods

> [!definition|3.3] Uniformly normal neighborhood
> A neighborhood $W \subset M$ is **uniformly normal** if there exists $S \ge 0$ so that each point $p\in W$ has a geodesic ball of radius at least $S$.


> Heuristically: every point has a geodesic ball of a *uniform* lower bound on the radius.

The pictures compare a uniformly normal region (like a cylinder) and a non-uniform one (like a cone narrowing to a tip).

> [!lemma|3.4] Existence of uniformly normal neighborhoods
> Any point $p\in M$ admits a uniformly normal neighborhood.

Illustration: there is a small ball $B_\varepsilon(p)$ contained in a larger uniformly normal neighborhood.

> The main idea is to compare, in normal coordinates, the Euclidean norm to the $g$–norm.


## 4. Geodesics and distance

### 4.1 Regular curves and length

> [!definition|4.1] Regular curve
> A curve
> $$
> \gamma : I \longrightarrow M
> $$
> is **regular** if
> $$
> \dot\gamma \neq 0 \quad \text{for all } t
> $$
> (which implies it admits a unit speed reparametrization).

For regular curves $\gamma : [a,b] \to M$, define the **length functional**
$$
L(\gamma) := \int_a^b \|\dot\gamma\|\,dt
$$

This is easily extended to **piecewise regular** curves, i.e. continuous curves that are a finite union of regular segments.
