# Chapter 2: Electrostatics

We begin with the fundamental problem of electrostatics: determining the force on a test charge $Q$ due to a source charge $q$. While **Coulomb's Law** gives the answer directly, the principle of **Superposition** allows us to generalize this to arbitrary charge distributions. To handle complex problems efficiently, we abstract the "force" into a "field" and develop differential equations (Maxwell's equations for electrostatics) to describe it.

## 2.1 The Electric Field

### 2.1.1 Introduction
The interaction between charges is described by the **Electric Field** $\mathbf{E}$. Instead of action-at-a-distance, we say the source charge $q$ creates a field $\mathbf{E}$, and a test charge $Q$ placed in that field experiences a force:
$$ \mathbf{F} = Q\mathbf{E} $$

### 2.1.2 Coulomb's Law
For a single point charge $q$ at the origin, the electric field at position $\mathbf{r}$ is:
$$ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} $$
where $\epsilon_0 \approx 8.85 \times 10^{-12}$ C$^2$/N$\cdot$m$^2$ is the permittivity of free space.

### 2.1.3 Continuous Charge Distributions
Using the **Principle of Superposition**, the field from a collection of charges is the vector sum of their individual fields. For a continuous distribution with volume charge density $\rho(\mathbf{r}')$, the sum becomes an integral:

> [!definition|2.1] (Electric Field of Continuous Charge)
> $$ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int \frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{r}}}}{\mathcal{r}^2} \rho(\mathbf{r}') \, d\tau' $$

Here, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{r}} = \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'$ is the separation vector pointing from the source to the point of evaluation.

## 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields

Calculating the integral (Def 2.1) is often difficult. We look for local differential equations that characterize the field.

### 2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss's Law
Electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges. The "amount" of field passing through a surface is the **Electric Flux** ($\Phi_E$):
$$ \Phi_E \equiv \int_{\mathcal{S}} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} $$

For a single point charge $q$ at the origin, the flux through a sphere of radius $r$ is:
$$ \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int \left( \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} \right) \cdot (r^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}) = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0} $$
Remarkably, this result is independent of the radius. Because field lines are continuous, any surface enclosing $q$ will intercept the same flux.

> [!theorem|2.1] (Gauss's Law - Integral Form)
> $$ \oint_{\mathcal{S}} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{\text{enc}} $$

Applying the Divergence Theorem, we convert this to differential form:
$$ \int_{\mathcal{V}} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}) d\tau = \oint_{\mathcal{S}} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \int_{\mathcal{V}} \rho \, d\tau $$

> [!theorem|2.2] (Gauss's Law - Differential Form)
> $$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$

This is the first of Maxwell's equations. It states that charge density is the source of divergence in $\mathbf{E}$.

### 2.2.2 The Curl of E
Because the Coulomb force is central (acting along the line joining charges), it is **conservative**. The work done moving a charge around a closed path is zero. Consequently, the line integral of $\mathbf{E}$ around any closed loop is zero:
$$ \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = 0 $$
Applying Stokes' Theorem:

> [!theorem|2.3] (Curl of Electrostatic Field)
> $$ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0} $$

This is only strictly true for *electrostatics*. If magnetic fields change with time, this rule breaks (Faraday's Law).

## 2.3 Electric Potential

### 2.3.1 Introduction to Potential
Because $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0$, we can (by the Helmholtz Theorem) define $\mathbf{E}$ as the gradient of a scalar function. We define the **Electric Potential** $V$ such that:

> [!definition|2.2] (Electric Potential)
> $$ \mathbf{E} = -\nabla V $$

Or, in integral form, relating potential difference to the path integral of the field:
$$ V(\mathbf{b}) - V(\mathbf{a}) = - \int_{\mathbf{a}}^{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} $$

**Why use Potential?**
1.  It is a scalar (easier to work with than the vector $\mathbf{E}$).
2.  It allows us to solve problems using energy methods.

### 2.3.2 Poisson's and Laplace's Equations
Combining the definition of potential ($\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V$) with Gauss's Law ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho/\epsilon_0$), we derive the fundamental differential equation of electrostatics:

> [!theorem|2.4] (Poisson's Equation)
> $$ \nabla^2 V = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$

In regions where $\rho = 0$, this becomes **Laplace's Equation**:
$$ \nabla^2 V = 0 $$

### 2.3.5 Boundary Conditions
Maxwell's equations impose specific constraints on fields across boundaries (like the surface of a charged sheet).
1.  **Normal Component:** Discontinuous due to surface charge $\sigma$.
    $$ E^{\perp}_{\text{above}} - E^{\perp}_{\text{below}} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} $$
2.  **Tangential Component:** Continuous (because $\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = 0$).
    $$ \mathbf{E}^{\parallel}_{\text{above}} = \mathbf{E}^{\parallel}_{\text{below}} $$
3.  **Potential:** Continuous everywhere (no infinite fields to create a jump in the integral).
    $$ V_{\text{above}} = V_{\text{below}} $$

## 2.4 Work and Energy

### 2.4.1 Work to Move a Charge
The potential difference $V(\mathbf{b}) - V(\mathbf{a})$ represents the work per unit charge required to move a particle from $\mathbf{a}$ to $\mathbf{b}$ against the electric field.
$$ W = Q [V(\mathbf{b}) - V(\mathbf{a})] $$

### 2.4.2 Energy of a Point Charge Distribution
To assemble a system of point charges, we must do work to bring them in from infinity against each other's fields.
$$ W = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n q_i V(\mathbf{r}_i) $$
where $V(\mathbf{r}_i)$ is the potential at point $i$ due to *all other* charges.

### 2.4.3 Energy of a Continuous Charge Distribution
For continuous charge, the sum becomes an integral. Using $\rho = \epsilon_0 \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}$ and integration by parts, we find the energy stored in the field itself:

> [!proposition|2.1] (Energy in Electric Field)
> $$ W = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \int_{\text{all space}} E^2 \, d\tau $$

This implies the energy is stored in the field with density $u = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} E^2$.

## 2.5 Conductors

### 2.5.1 Basic Properties
A conductor contains charges that are free to move. In **electrostatic equilibrium** (no current flowing), this leads to strict physical constraints:

1.  **$\mathbf{E} = 0$ inside the conductor.** (If it weren't, charges would move).
2.  **$\rho = 0$ inside the conductor.** (Follows from Gauss's law: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$).
3.  **Net charge resides on the surface.**
4.  **A conductor is an equipotential.** ($V$ is constant throughout).
5.  **$\mathbf{E}$ is perpendicular to the surface.** (Otherwise, tangential forces would move surface charges).

### 2.5.4 Capacitors
Since a conductor is an equipotential, if we have two conductors with charges $+Q$ and $-Q$, there is a fixed potential difference $V$ between them. The ratio is geometric:

> [!definition|2.3] (Capacitance)
> $$ C \equiv \frac{Q}{V} $$

The work required to charge a capacitor is stored as potential energy:
$$ W = \frac{1}{2} CV^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^2}{C} $$
