# Chapter 1: Vector Analysis

Electrodynamics is the study of electromagnetic fields—vector functions that exist at every point in space. To describe how these fields change and interact, we require the language of **Vector Analysis**. This chapter builds the mathematical foundation, moving from simple algebra to the calculus of vector fields ($\nabla$) and the fundamental integral theorems that relate local field behavior to macroscopic quantities.

## 1.1 Vector Algebra and Separation Vectors

While vector addition and multiplication (dot and cross products) are standard, electrodynamics relies heavily on relative positions. We must distinguish between the location of a source charge and the location where we measure the field.

### 1.1.4 Separation Vector
In almost every problem, we deal with two position vectors:
1.  **Source point ($\mathbf{r}'$):** Where the charge is located.
2.  **Field point ($\mathbf{r}$):** Where we are calculating the field.

The physical quantities depend on the relative distance between them. Griffiths introduces a special script vector $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{r}}$ (script-r) to represent this **separation vector**:

> [!definition|1.1] (Separation Vector)
> $$ \boldsymbol{\mathcal{r}} \equiv \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}' $$

The magnitude is $\mathcal{r} = |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|$, and the unit vector pointing from source to field is:
$$ \hat{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{r}}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{r}}}{\mathcal{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|} $$

*Note: Be extremely careful not to confuse $\mathcal{r}$ (distance from source) with $r$ (distance from origin).*

## 1.2 Differential Calculus: The Del Operator

We utilize a vector operator $\nabla$ ("del") to measure how fields change in space. It acts as a vector of derivatives:
$$ \nabla = \hat{\mathbf{x}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{\mathbf{y}}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{\mathbf{z}}\frac{\partial}{\partial z} $$

Using $\nabla$, we construct three fundamental derivatives.

### 1.2.2 The Gradient ($\nabla T$)
For a scalar function $T$ (like temperature or Electric Potential), the gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase. Its magnitude is the slope in that direction.

> [!theorem|1.1] (Geometric Interpretation of Gradient)
> $$ dT = (\nabla T) \cdot d\mathbf{l} $$
> A small change in position $d\mathbf{l}$ results in a change in the scalar function $dT$ determined by the projection of $d\mathbf{l}$ onto the gradient.

### 1.2.4 The Divergence ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}$)
For a vector field $\mathbf{v}$, the divergence is a scalar that measures how much the vector "spreads out" (diverges) from a point.
$$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} $$
*   **Positive divergence:** A "source" (e.g., positive charge).
*   **Negative divergence:** A "sink" (e.g., negative charge).

### 1.2.5 The Curl ($\nabla \times \mathbf{v}$)
The curl is a vector that measures how much the field "swirls" or circulates around a point.
$$ \nabla \times \mathbf{v} = \left| \begin{matrix} \hat{\mathbf{x}} & \hat{\mathbf{y}} & \hat{\mathbf{z}} \\ \partial/\partial x & \partial/\partial y & \partial/\partial z \\ v_x & v_y & v_z \end{matrix} \right| $$

## 1.3 Integral Calculus: The Fundamental Theorems

There are three fundamental theorems that link differential operations (what is happening *at* a point) to integral operations (what is happening *over* a region). These are the tools used to convert Maxwell's equations from differential to integral form.

### 1.3.3 Fundamental Theorem for Gradients
This is the vector calculus equivalent of $\int_a^b (df/dx)dx = f(b) - f(a)$.

> [!theorem|1.2] (Fundamental Theorem for Gradients)
> $$ \int_{\mathbf{a}}^{\mathbf{b}} (\nabla T) \cdot d\mathbf{l} = T(\mathbf{b}) - T(\mathbf{a}) $$

*   **Implication:** Line integrals of gradients are **path independent**; they depend only on the end points.
*   **Corollary:** $\oint (\nabla T) \cdot d\mathbf{l} = 0$ for any closed loop. This characterizes conservative forces (like Electrostatics).

### 1.3.4 The Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)
This theorem relates the flow of a vector field out of a volume to the "sources" (divergence) inside.

> [!theorem|1.3] (Divergence Theorem)
> $$ \int_{\mathcal{V}} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}) d\tau = \oint_{\mathcal{S}} \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{a} $$

*   **Intuition:** If you treat the vector field as the flow of water, the total water created inside a region (sum of divergences) must equal the total water flowing out through the surface (flux).

### 1.3.5 The Curl Theorem (Stokes' Theorem)
This theorem relates the swirl on a surface to the circulation around its edge.

> [!theorem|1.4] (Stokes' Theorem)
> $$ \int_{\mathcal{S}} (\nabla \times \mathbf{v}) \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \oint_{\mathcal{P}} \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l} $$

*   **Intuition:** If you break a surface into tiny loops, the internal currents cancel out, leaving only the flow along the boundary perimeter $\mathcal{P}$.

## 1.4 Curvilinear Coordinates

Most electrodynamics problems possess spherical or cylindrical symmetry. While coordinates $(x,y,z)$ are constant, curvilinear unit vectors ($\hat{\mathbf{r}}, \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}, \hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$) **change direction** depending on position.

*   **Warning:** You generally cannot pull unit vectors like $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ outside of an integral, because they are functions of position!
*   **Vector Derivatives:** The formulas for $\nabla$, divergence, and curl are significantly more complex in these systems (they contain geometric factors like $1/r$ or $1/s$).

> [!remark|1.1] (Spherical Volume Element)
> $$ d\tau = r^2 \sin\theta \, dr \, d\theta \, d\phi $$

## 1.5 The Dirac Delta Function

Classical electrodynamics deals with point charges—finite charge at a single point of zero volume. This creates a mathematical crisis: the charge density $\rho = dq/d\tau$ is infinite at that point and zero elsewhere. To handle this, we use the **Dirac Delta Function**.

### 1.5.1 The Divergence of $\hat{\mathbf{r}}/r^2$
Consider the field $\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
1.  Calculated naively using standard calculus, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$ everywhere (for $r \neq 0$).
2.  However, the surface integral (flux) over a sphere is $\oint \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \oint \frac{1}{R^2} R^2 \sin\theta d\theta d\phi = 4\pi$.
3.  By the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of divergence must be $4\pi$, not 0.

The divergence is zero everywhere *except* the origin, where it is infinite such that the integral is finite.

> [!definition|1.2] (The Three-Dimensional Delta Function)
> $$ \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2} \right) = 4\pi \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) $$

This function acts as a sieve. Under an integral, it picks out the value of the function at the specific point where the delta function "spikes":
$$ \int_{\text{all space}} f(\mathbf{r}) \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{a}) d\tau = f(\mathbf{a}) $$

## 1.6 The Theory of Vector Fields (Helmholtz Theorem)

Why do we define exactly two vector derivatives (Divergence and Curl)? The **Helmholtz Theorem** assures us that these two quantities are sufficient to fully determine a vector field (that vanishes at infinity).

> [!theorem|1.5] (Helmholtz Theorem)
> A vector field $\mathbf{F}$ is uniquely determined if its divergence $D(\mathbf{r})$ and its curl $\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{r})$ are specified everywhere (assuming $\mathbf{F} \to 0$ at $\infty$).

### 1.6.2 Potentials
The theorem implies two special cases crucial for Physics:

**1. Irrotational Fields (Curl-free)**
If $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 0$ everywhere, then:
*   $\oint \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = 0$ (Conservative).
*   $\mathbf{F}$ can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential:
    $$ \mathbf{F} = -\nabla V $$

**2. Solenoidal Fields (Divergence-free)**
If $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = 0$ everywhere, then:
*   $\oint \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = 0$ (Flux through closed surface is zero).
*   $\mathbf{F}$ can be written as the curl of a vector potential:
    $$ \mathbf{F} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A} $$
