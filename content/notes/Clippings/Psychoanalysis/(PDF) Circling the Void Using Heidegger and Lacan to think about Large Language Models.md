## Abstract

The paper aims to unite two currently distinct ways of thinking about and working with language. Large language models and continental philosophy, especially Martin Heidegger's thinking about language and, building on Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan's structural psychoanalysis. We show that the concept of language that Heidegger, Freud, and Lacan discussed and utilized in clinical frameworks is quite well matched by modern LLMs. This allows us to discuss a problem of negation and negativity that is central to continental discourse but absent from current LLM research. This also means that we offer a radically different approach than is usual in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, since we base our concepts on thinkers who are often neglected in the discourse of analytic philosophy that is closer to AI research. To this end, we also indicate where the ontological differences of the proposed approach lie. Our aim, however, is to address both AI researchers and continental philosophers.

Introduction Freud proposed that names of clinically salient objects or situations, such as for example a beetle ( Käfer ) in Mr. E’s panic attack, refer through their phonological word form, and not through their meaning, to etiologically important events—here, “ Que faire? ” which summarizes the indecisiveness of Mr. E’s mother concerning her marriage with Mr. E’s father. Lacan formalized these ideas, attributing full-fledged mental effectiveness to the signifier, and summarized this as “the unconscious structured as a language”. We tested one aspect of this theory, namely that there is an influence of the ambiguous phonological translation of the world upon our mental processing without us being aware of this influence. Methods For this, we used a rebus priming paradigm, including 14 French rebuses, composed of two images depicting common objects, such as paon /pã/ “peacock” and terre /tεr/ “earth,” together forming the rebus panthère /pãtεr/ “panther.” These images were followed by a target word semantically related to the rebus resolution, e.g., félin “feline,” upon which the participants, unaware of the rebus principle, produced 6 written associations. A total of 1,458 participants were randomly assigned either to Experiment 1 in which they were shown the rebus images in either forward or in reverse order or to Experiment 2, in which they were shown only one of both rebus images, either the first or the last. Results and discussion The results show that the images induced inadvertent rebus priming in naïve participants. In other words, our results show that people solve rebuses unwittingly independent of stimulus order, thereby constituting empirical evidence for the mental effectiveness of the signifier.

Negation is a complex linguistic phenomenon present in all human languages. It can be seen as an operator that transforms an expression into another expression whose meaning is in some way opposed to the original expression. In this article, we survey previous work on negation with an emphasis on computational approaches. We start defining negation and two important concepts: scope and focus of negation. Then, we survey work in natural language processing that considers negation primarily as a means to improve the results in some task. We also provide information about corpora containing negation annotations in English and other languages, which usually include a combination of annotations of negation cues, scopes, foci, and negated events. We continue the survey with a description of automated approaches to process negation, ranging from early rule-based systems to systems built with traditional machine learning and neural networks. Finally, we conclude with some reflections on current progress and future directions.

Pre-training by language modeling has become a popular and successful approach to NLP tasks, but we have yet to understand exactly what linguistic capacities these pre-training processes confer upon models. In this paper we introduce a suite of diagnostics drawn from human language experiments, which allow us to ask targeted questions about information used by language models for generating predictions in context. As a case study, we apply these diagnostics to the popular BERT model, finding that it can generally distinguish good from bad completions involving shared category or role reversal, albeit with less sensitivity than humans, and it robustly retrieves noun hypernyms, but it struggles with challenging inference and role-based event prediction— and, in particular, it shows clear insensitivity to the contextual impacts of negation.

Book synopsis: For the last two centuries, Western philosophy has developed in the shadow of Hegel, whose influence each new thinker tries in vain to escape. As a consequence, Hegel's absolute idealism has become the bogeyman of philosophy, obscuring his dominance as the philosopher of the epochal historical transition to modernity. In Less Than Nothing, the pinnacle publication of a distinguished career, Slavoj Žižek argues that it is imperative we not simply return to Hegel but we repeat and exceed his triumphs, overcoming his limitations by being even more Hegelian than the master himself. Such an approach not only enables Žižek to diagnose our present condition, but also to engage in a critical dialogue with the key strands of contemporary thought. Modernity will begin and end with Hegel.
