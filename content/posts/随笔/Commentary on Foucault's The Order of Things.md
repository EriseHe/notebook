# Close Reading Commentary 

The selected quote is from Foucaultâ€™s early-stage (1960s) intellectual project of philosophical "archaeology", which was his first major methodological phase. He presents a radical historical analysis of knowledge in The Order of Things, intending to eliminate the assumption of unchanging criteria for knowledge.

This quote sits at the center of his archaeological method, in which he attempted "to bring to light" the underlying episteme of knowledge. This recursive long sentence, broken down into three main modifiers, describes the epistemological field, which almost, if not intentionally, resembles the idea of a "field" in physics - an invisible but structured influence that determines how objects behave within it. The traditional epistemological assumption that he challenged holds that knowledge is grounded by universal standards of rationality and objectivity, and the first modifier sets the stage for this argument. Foucault subverts this unchanging framework by treating it as historically contingent, or specifically, one of the possible conditions "having reference" to rationality and objectivity.

The second modifier, "grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history," presents one of his most radical takes on epistemology. The positivity of knowledge is constructed within the space established by the historical *a* *priori*, is thus validated by what is possible to be discovered as "knowledge." For Foucault, the corresponding relationship between how well knowledge describes reality and knowledge itself is radically destabilized, because there is no objective guarantee of such a relationship, given that epistemes structure our perception and thus make reality itself historically conditioned.

The third modifier further develops this idea and explicitly rejects the notion of a progression of knowledge towards "growing perfection." It is surprising for me to interpret that not only is progression non-linear and discontinuous, but progression itself simply cannot exist, precisely because epistemic ruptures shift the framework of what counts as knowledge and make previous ways of thinking unthinkable. (It reminds me of Thomas Kuhn's view on science, but the preservation of continuity is completely abandoned.) Since the episteme structures the conditions under which the history of knowledge unfolds, it determines the framework within which historical institutions and discourses "ground" knowledge as legitimate.

This directly supports his examination of discourses on madness, crime, and sexuality, and how the changing episteme of madness throughout history, for example, redefines its implications - whether through the logic of confinement or its later medicalization under psychiatric authority. My close reading of this passage really forced me to zoom out from the sciences I have been studying and reflect on the historical illusion of epistemic progress.
