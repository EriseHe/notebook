title: "Commentary on the Collage"
---


Language is the medium through which reason is articulated. The text I picked up was "outside of the language", which naturally reminds me of an exteriority (the Real) with which the topology of the Lacanian model is most concerned. However, in the Foucauldian context, the concept of "outside" is still within the realm of sense, but strategically excluded. This collage exercise really pushed me to make an explicit distinction between how these frameworks would interpret such a phrase differently.

More specifically, it is a (structurally) impossible task to portray the "outside of language" for Lacan, since language itself fails constitutively in any attempts to capture it; for Foucault, the *outside* of the language, as structured by discursive formations, marks the space where reason ceases to function, and madness emerges as that which exceeds the specific "order" of language. As a parallel metaphor and an aesthetic practice, I scrambled the interior of words to preserve the readability of the text through a technique known as typoglycemia:

$$\text{ Osiutde fo teh lnaguage}$$

This creates a sense of "disorder", but only a surface-level incoherence. I intend to demonstrate a *readable* disorder - when we disrupt the "order" of the language to create incomprehensibility, the meaning may still persist, and the excluded or unintelligible might become *readable* under other discursive regimes.

When making this collage, the biggest question that lingered in my head was: where can the ship of fools actually go? The answer is unknown, but in this collage, I created an "other world" for them, textured by Jackson Pollock's famous Autumn Rhythm - a chaotic but unconsciously ordered artwork. The ships of fools traveled through waves of mojibake (garbled text caused by incompatible character encoding), across the borders of discourse, towards a land that turns "unreason" into "reason". Although their journey is meant to be marked by uncertainty, this collage provided me a chance to settle them! They no longer need to tragically navigate the "barren wasteland between two lands that can never be his own".
