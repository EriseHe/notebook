# Converting 2D Anime-Style Clothing to 3D: Tools & Workflow

Creating 3D clothing from 2D anime-style references (like Genshin Impact outfits) is now faster with AI-assisted tools, though manual refinement is often needed for the best results. This guide focuses on **clothing conversion** – taking 2D images of robes, armor, or accessories and turning them into stylized 3D meshes with clean topology. We’ll explore the top AI tools and workflows (as of 2025) and outline a step-by-step process compatible with Blender.

## Key Requirements for 2D-to-3D Clothing Conversion

- **Stylized Fidelity:** The 3D clothing should match the anime/Genshin Impact aesthetic of the concept art (shapes, folds, and design details).
- **Optimized Topology:** Meshes need clean, animation-friendly topology (proper edge loops, reasonable polycount) for attaching to a rigged character.
- **Texture & Detail:** Preserve clothing details (patterns, trims, armor segments) either as modeled geometry or textures/normal maps.
- **Rigging Compatibility:** The generated clothing must fit the existing character and allow weight painting or rig transfers so it deforms correctly during animation.
- **Minimal Restrictions:** Tools that allow creative freedom (no strict content rules) are preferred so any custom outfit design can be used.

## AI-Powered Tools for Image-to-3D Clothing Conversion

Modern AI tools can convert a single 2D image into a 3D model in minutes ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20The%20Benefits%20of%20AI,3D%20Model%20Creation)). These are particularly useful to get a **base 3D mesh** of a clothing piece quickly, which can then be refined. Below are some of the best options:

- **Meshy AI (Image to 3D):** A popular AI 3D model generator with an image-to-3D feature and even a Blender plugin ([Meshy AI - The #1 AI 3D Model Generator for Creators](https://www.meshy.ai/#:~:text=Downloads)) ([Meshy AI - The #1 AI 3D Model Generator for Creators](https://www.meshy.ai/#:~:text=%E2%9C%A8%20Meshy%20at%20GDC%202025)). Meshy supports different art styles (including anime) for output ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=Behind%20this%20technology%20lies%20computer,precision%20by%20employing%20multiple%20perspectives)) ([Meshy AI - The #1 AI 3D Model Generator for Creators](https://www.meshy.ai/#:~:text=Sculpture)). You upload concept art or reference photos and get a 3D model with textures. _Pros:_ Fast cloud generation, supports **versatile art styles** (can capture stylized looks) ([Meshy AI - The #1 AI 3D Model Generator for Creators](https://www.meshy.ai/#:~:text=Sculpture)), exports to common formats (OBJ, FBX, GLB, etc.) for easy Blender import ([Meshy AI - The #1 AI 3D Model Generator for Creators](https://www.meshy.ai/#:~:text=Versatile%203D%20Formats)). _Cons:_ Paid service (free tier available with limits), and results may require cleanup if topology is dense or if some parts are inaccurate.
    
- **Mazing AI / 3DFY.ai:** Services that turn single images into 3D models with a focus on realism and high quality ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=Behind%20this%20technology%20lies%20computer,precision%20by%20employing%20multiple%20perspectives)). Mazing (an e-commerce oriented tool) emphasizes automatic texturing and real-time optimization ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=The%20AI%20system%20will%20take,quality%20result)) ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=step%20is%20recommended%20if%20you,product%20configurators)). 3DFY.ai similarly promises high-quality results from one image ([3DFY.ai](https://3dfy.ai/#:~:text=3DFY,anyone%20can%20quickly%20create)). _Pros:_ Quick image to model conversion; optimized for product visuals. _Cons:_ May be geared towards realistic objects; stylized anime clothing might need additional editing to match the art style.
    
- **Kaedim and Alternatives (Tripo 3D, Alpha3D):** Kaedim is an AI-assisted service where you upload an image (even a sketch or concept) and their pipeline (ML + human touch-ups) delivers a 3D model ([Kaedim Alternatives in 2025 | Best Kaedim Alternatives - Toolify](https://www.toolify.ai/alternative/kaedim#:~:text=Kaedim%20is%20a%20platform%20that,the%20touch%20of%20a%20button)). Tripo 3D offers a similar “single image to 3D in seconds” solution with emphasis on **detailed geometry and textures** ([Kaedim Alternatives in 2025 | Best Kaedim Alternatives - Toolify](https://www.toolify.ai/alternative/kaedim#:~:text=Pros)). Alpha3D provides image-to-3D generation but currently only for certain categories (e.g. shoes, furniture) ([Transform text and 2D images into 3D assets with generative AI for free - Alpha3D](https://www.alpha3d.io/#:~:text=Please%20note%2C%20this%20AI%20model,object%20categories%3A%20shoes%20and%20furniture)). _Pros:_ These services deliver **production-ready assets** with textures and decent topology, suitable for game engines ([Kaedim Alternatives in 2025 | Best Kaedim Alternatives - Toolify](https://www.toolify.ai/alternative/kaedim#:~:text=Kaedim%20has%201%20core%20features%2C,including)). _Cons:_ They are paid services (some with subscriptions) and may have category limits. Quality can vary – often a good starting point but still might need retopology for optimal loops.
    
- **The New Black (AI Fashion Generator):** A specialized tool for fashion design that can turn an outfit image into a **realistic 3D clothing model** ([AI Fashion Features | Clothing Design](https://thenewblack.ai/ai-design-features#:~:text=AI%20Fashion%20Features%20,realistic%203D%20clothing%20model%20in)). It’s geared toward apparel designers (e.g. previewing how a garment looks in 3D). _Pros:_ Focused on clothing, likely good with fabric details like folds and drape. _Cons:_ Primarily aimed at realistic fashion; you might need to simplify or stylize the output for anime characters. Also, it may output standalone clothing on a generic avatar that you’ll have to refit to your character.
    
- **Hunyuan 3D (Tencent):** An AI model available via HuggingFace that generates 3D meshes from an image (used in the community alongside Meshy) ([Do you know an AI to create cloth and outfit? - Daz 3D Forums](https://www.daz3d.com/forums/discussion/718631/do-you-know-an-ai-to-create-cloth-and-outfit?srsltid=AfmBOoomwxIla2fJBW4U5R1q0toLi4liC7wLuDdouyO363UPTKht3FrM#:~:text=,baked%20vertex%20textures%20onto%20it)). It’s free to try and can handle characters or clothes. _Pros:_ Free and accessible; known to work for generating a rough clothed figure mesh. _Cons:_ The output might be a combined human+clothes mesh (if the input was a full character image) and will definitely require **manual retopology** and separation of the clothing. Good for getting the overall shape of a complex outfit, but not a final game-ready mesh.
    
- **“Pic-to-3D Mesh” Blender Add-on:** An add-on that integrates AI image-to-3D conversion directly in Blender ([Top AI Tools for Model Generation on Blender 3D - Vagon](https://vagon.io/blog/top-ai-tools-for-model-generation-on-blender-3d#:~:text=Tool%208%3A%20Pic%20To%203D,Mesh)). You can input a reference image (e.g. a front view of a costume) and it generates a **detailed 3D mesh** inside Blender ([Top AI Tools for Model Generation on Blender 3D - Vagon](https://vagon.io/blog/top-ai-tools-for-model-generation-on-blender-3d#:~:text=Pic%20To%203D%20Mesh%20is,customization%20of%20the%20generated%20models)). _Pros:_ Fully inside Blender – no need to use external apps; straightforward UI and quick conversion with just a few clicks ([Top AI Tools for Model Generation on Blender 3D - Vagon](https://vagon.io/blog/top-ai-tools-for-model-generation-on-blender-3d#:~:text=Pic%20To%203D%20Mesh%20is,customization%20of%20the%20generated%20models)). This is useful to instantly get a mesh that you can start editing in the same session. _Cons:_ Being relatively new, results can be hit-or-miss on complex armor or multi-layer outfits; likely works best for simpler garments or accessory pieces.
    
- **PixelModeler AI (Blender Add-on):** A unique workflow where you **paint on a 2D canvas in Blender** and an AI generates a corresponding 3D mesh ([PixelModeller AI - Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/pixelmodeller-ai#:~:text=Use%20the%20power%20of%20AI,for%20rendering%20and%203d%20printing)) ([PixelModeller AI - Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/pixelmodeller-ai#:~:text=you%20paint%20in%20the%202d,for%20rendering%20and%203d%20printing)). This can be used by painting the silhouette or even a depth map of the clothing; the addon will create a solid mesh from it. Generated models are **watertight, UV-mapped, and come with vertex colors** (a basic texture) ([Top AI Tools for Model Generation on Blender 3D - Vagon](https://vagon.io/blog/top-ai-tools-for-model-generation-on-blender-3d#:~:text=Image)), ready for further detailing. _Pros:_ Gives a lot of control – you essentially guide the shape by painting, so it’s AI-assisted modeling rather than fully automatic. No external service needed (the AI model runs locally) ([PixelModeller AI - Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/pixelmodeller-ai#:~:text=for%20rendering%20and%203d%20printing%21)). _Cons:_ There is a learning curve to painting effective guides. It won’t automatically produce intricate patterns – you’ll need to add those via texture or additional modeling.

## AI-Assisted + Manual Workflow Strategies

Fully automated results often need human improvement. In practice, the best quality comes from **combining AI generation with manual modeling** ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=enhancement%20process%20to%20improve%20textures,product%20configurators)). Here are some AI-assisted workflows that clothing artists use:

- **Image Inpainting + Mesh Generation:** One clever approach is to use AI image tools to conceptually dress your character, then extract a model. For example, a community-suggested workflow is: _render your character’s base body in T-pose, use an AI image editor (like Stable Diffusion inpainting or Photoshop’s generative fill) to “paint” new clothes onto the image, isolate just the garment in the edited image, then input that into an image-to-3D tool (Meshy or Hunyuan) to get a 3D mesh_ ([Do you know an AI to create cloth and outfit? - Daz 3D Forums](https://www.daz3d.com/forums/discussion/718631/do-you-know-an-ai-to-create-cloth-and-outfit?srsltid=AfmBOoomwxIla2fJBW4U5R1q0toLi4liC7wLuDdouyO363UPTKht3FrM#:~:text=,baked%20vertex%20textures%20onto%20it)). This way, the AI helps create a consistent design on the body and another AI turns it into geometry. You’d still need to retopologize and UV map the result manually ([Do you know an AI to create cloth and outfit? - Daz 3D Forums](https://www.daz3d.com/forums/discussion/718631/do-you-know-an-ai-to-create-cloth-and-outfit?srsltid=AfmBOoomwxIla2fJBW4U5R1q0toLi4liC7wLuDdouyO363UPTKht3FrM#:~:text=garment%20,baked%20vertex%20textures%20onto%20it)), but it jumpstarts the modeling process for complex costumes.
    
- **Depth Map Extraction:** If you have a front-view concept art of the outfit, you can generate a depth map (using AI like MiDaS or Stable Diffusion depth estimation). That depth map can be used to displace a plane or guide a mesh generation. Tools like PixelModeler AI automate this: they _generate a depth internally from the image and produce a mesh_ ([PixelModeller AI - Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/pixelmodeller-ai#:~:text=for%20rendering%20and%203d%20printing%21)). The output will capture the relief (folds, protrusions) from the concept art, though you’ll have to model or guess the back side of the garment. This method is useful for armor pieces or relief details on clothing that are visible in the concept.
    
- **Template-Based Generation (Parametric):** Some solutions use **parametric templates** plus AI for customization. Sloyd.ai, for instance, combines a library of human-made base models with AI adjustments, ensuring the result is _game-ready with UV maps and LODs generated, and optimized meshes_ ([SLOYD AI: A 3D Automation Tool To Generate Game-Ready Assets – startupanz.com](https://startupanz.com/sloyd-a-3d-automation-tool-generating-game-ready-assets/#:~:text=asset%20changes)). If there are clothing templates (e.g. a generic T-shirt, jacket, dress) you can morph those to roughly match your design and let the tool handle topology. This is semi-manual: you pick the base closest to your design and tweak. _Note:_ As of 2025, parametric generators like Sloyd have many props and environment assets; clothing templates might be limited, but the approach guarantees clean topology if a template fits your needs.
    
- **Manual Sculpt with AI Reference:** Another assisted route is using the AI output as a reference or base mesh and then manually sculpting over it. For example, you can take a coarse mesh from an AI, bring it into Blender, and use multiresolution sculpting or retopology tools (like Quad Remesher or Blender’s shrinkwrap) to **impose a clean topology** that follows the AI model’s shape. The AI model essentially serves as a 3D concept sketch. You can also project the texture from the AI model (if it provided one) onto your new topology for a starting point.
    

## Manual Tools for 3D Clothing Creation

While AI is speeding things up, manual modeling tools are still crucial, especially for achieving the cleanest results and stylized looks:

- **Marvelous Designer / CLO3D:** These are industry-standard tools for designing clothing using pattern-based simulation. You draw 2D garment patterns, sew them, and the software simulates the cloth on a avatar model – perfect for creating natural folds and drapes. _Pros:_ Extremely high fidelity cloth behavior; great for layered outfits, pleats, ruffles, etc. You can match an anime costume by designing similar patterns. Marvelous can even auto-generate PBR texture maps like normal and opacity for details ([[Tips&Tricks] Discover Better Workflow with Marvelous Designer and Unreal Engine – Marvelous Designer](https://support.marvelousdesigner.com/hc/en-us/articles/41062062862745--Tips-Tricks-Discover-Better-Workflow-with-Marvelous-Designer-and-Unreal-Engine#:~:text=applied%20accordion%20pleat%20effect%20with,jpg)). _Cons:_ The meshes are triangulated and high-poly (since it’s focused on simulation). You will need to **retopologize** the garment for use in a game or realtime engine ([Retopology of Marvelous Designer Clothes in Blender - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4E9gAx6KHU#:~:text=YouTube%20www,cloth%20look%20good%20in%20animation)). Marvelous has introduced some retopo tools (EveryWear Auto-Retopology) and can even rig garments, but often external retopo (using Blender or ZBrush) gives more control. Despite not being AI, Marvelous is frequently recommended for creating custom outfits ([Do you know an AI to create cloth and outfit? - Daz 3D Forums](https://www.daz3d.com/forums/discussion/718631/do-you-know-an-ai-to-create-cloth-and-outfit?srsltid=AfmBOoomwxIla2fJBW4U5R1q0toLi4liC7wLuDdouyO363UPTKht3FrM#:~:text=January%2025)) because of the quality of the result. The typical workflow is simulate in Marvelous → export OBJ → retopo in Blender → transfer to character rig.

([[Tips&Tricks] Discover Better Workflow with Marvelous Designer and Unreal Engine – Marvelous Designer](https://support.marvelousdesigner.com/hc/en-us/articles/41062062862745--Tips-Tricks-Discover-Better-Workflow-with-Marvelous-Designer-and-Unreal-Engine)) _Example of a stylized 3D outfit created with cloth simulation._ _(This fairy-like garment was designed and simulated in Marvelous Designer, showcasing layered fabric, ruffles, and realistic folds.)_

- **Blender’s Sewing/Cloth Tools:** If you prefer open-source, Blender itself has cloth simulation and addons like **Garment Tool** that mimic Marvelous’s pattern sewing approach. You can import your character into Blender, model garment panels (or even trace them from reference images), then use cloth physics to drape them. The result can then be applied as a shape key or applied mesh. You’ll still need to manually refine the mesh topology. Blender’s sculpting tools (cloth brush, slide relax, etc.) can also help adjust folds. This approach is manual and requires skill, but no additional cost.
    
- **Direct Poly Modeling:** For hard-surface armor pieces or very structured outfits (like a mech suit or a rigid breastplate), classic poly modeling or box modeling in Blender might be the way to go. You can use the 2D image as a reference in the background and model the clothing piece by piece (ensuring proper topology as you go). This is time-consuming but yields the cleanest meshes. You might use AI just to generate normals or texture details in this case, rather than the mesh.
    
- **Retopology & Refinement Tools:** No matter which initial method you choose, **retopology tools** are vital for clothing. Blender has a PolyBuild and Snap-to-face retopo workflow, and add-ons like RetopoFlow can speed it up. If you have ZBrush, ZRemesher can quickly re-mesh a triangulated Marvelous output into quads, which you can then tweak. There are also auto-retopology AI in development – for instance, some research tools attempt to auto-retopo meshes with neural networks, but in practice most artists still do this part manually or with traditional algorithms. The goal is to end up with edge loops around openings (neck, arm holes) and ideally follow the flow of fabric folds with the topology for deformation.
    

## Recommended Workflow (Step-by-Step)

Bringing it all together, here is a step-by-step workflow to convert a 2D outfit into a 3D mesh and attach it to your Blender character, using the best of AI and manual tools:

**1. Gather Reference Images:** Ideally have the concept art or reference of the clothing from as many angles as possible. A front view is usually required for AI tools; a side or back view (if available) will help during modeling or can be fed into some tools for better accuracy. If only a front view exists, be prepared to interpret the design for the unseen parts.

**2. Choose an AI Generation Method for Base Mesh:** For a head start, pick one of the AI approaches:

- _Option A:_ Use **Meshy AI** (or similar service) to upload the clothing image and generate a 3D model. Download the result (e.g. as a `.glb` or `.obj`) when ready ([Meshy AI - The #1 AI 3D Model Generator for Creators](https://www.meshy.ai/#:~:text=Versatile%203D%20Formats)).
    
- _Option B:_ In **Blender**, install the Pic-to-3D Mesh addon and run it on your reference image to get a mesh ([Top AI Tools for Model Generation on Blender 3D - Vagon](https://vagon.io/blog/top-ai-tools-for-model-generation-on-blender-3d#:~:text=Pic%20To%203D%20Mesh%20is,customization%20of%20the%20generated%20models)).
    
- _Option C:_ If the outfit is very complex or you want a full mannequin with clothing, try the **Hunyuan 3D** demo by providing an image of the clothed character; then extract the clothing mesh from the output.
    
- _Option D:_ If you have a concept sketch, consider **Kaedim/Tripo** services for a perhaps cleaner base model (they might return the model next day or in a couple of hours, which you can then use).
    
    Regardless of option, don’t expect a perfect final model – treat this as a rough draft or proof of concept in 3D. It should capture the overall shape and major details of the clothing.
    

**3. Import and Inspect in Blender:** Bring the generated 3D model into Blender. Center and scale it to your character. At this stage:

- Check the mesh density and topology. Are there a lot of uneven triangles or random bumps?
- Check if all parts of the outfit are present. Sometimes single-view reconstructions leave holes or undefined backs. You may need to **patch holes** (Blender’s Fill or Grid Fill can help) or even mirror parts of the mesh if symmetry can be assumed.
- If the tool provided textures, apply them to see the look. However, for anime style, you might later hand-paint textures or use simple materials, so textures are optional.

**4. Retopologize the Clothing Mesh:** This is crucial for **optimization**. You can use Blender’s retopology tools to create a new mesh over the AI mesh:

- Add a **shrinkwrap modifier** on a new mesh and model low-poly geometry that tightly wraps the AI model. Focus on quads and logical edge flow (e.g. edge loops around cuffs, hemlines, and along seams).
- Alternatively, use an auto-retopo tool: for example, _Instant Meshes_ (free tool) or _Quad Remesher_ (paid) to get a quick quad mesh. You might still tweak the output by hand.
- Ensure the retopo’d mesh has proper **thickness** where needed (you can solidify later if it’s cloth, but parts like armor might be modeled as solid pieces).
- UV unwrap the new mesh if not already UV’d. Good UVs are needed for texturing anime-style details (like emblems or gradients on the fabric).

**5. Fit and Attach to the Character:** Place the new clothing mesh on the character in the correct pose (usually T-pose or A-pose matching the rig). To attach:

- Use **Blender’s Transfer Weights**: parent the clothing to the armature (with empty groups), then select the body, then clothing, and use _Weight Transfer_ (source: body, destination: clothing). This copies the rig weights so the clothing will move with the body ([How separte clothes for Animatoion? - CG Cookie](https://cgcookie.com/community/10724-how-separte-clothes-for-animatoion#:~:text=How%20separte%20clothes%20for%20Animatoion%3F,Rigging)).
- Check deformation by posing the character. Likely you will need to clean up weights (for instance, ensure sleeves move with the arms, etc. without too much clipping).
- If the clothing is very close to the body, you might need to **delete hidden faces** of the character under the clothes to avoid mesh clipping in tight areas (e.g. remove torso polygons under a shirt).
- For rigid pieces (like armor plates), you may instead want to assign them to a specific bone and keep them rigid or use a **bone parent** for that object.

**6. Detail and Texture:** Now polish the visual fidelity:

- Sculpt or model finer folds that the AI may have missed. You can use Blender’s **sculpt mode** with the cloth brush or crease brush to imprint additional wrinkle lines where appropriate.
- Add thickness to cloth if it’s just a single surface (Solidify modifier). Stylized outfits often have a bit of thickness at edges (e.g. a coat lapel).
- **Texture Painting:** For anime style, a lot of detail can come from textures (like painted shadows or highlights, stylized fabric patterns). You can paint directly in Blender or use Substance 3D Painter. If the original 2D image has patterns (say, a symbol on the back of a cape), use it as a reference or even project it onto your UV map.
- Generate normal maps if needed. For example, if the outfit has an engraved design or stitching that is too fine to model, you can paint a height map and bake it to a normal map. Some AI tools can assist in generating texture maps from descriptions (e.g. Meshy has an AI texturing feature) ([Kaedim Alternatives in 2025 | Best Kaedim Alternatives - Toolify](https://www.toolify.ai/alternative/kaedim#:~:text=)), which could be used to create stylized fabric textures by prompting.

**7. Iterate and Refine:** After these steps, you should have the clothing on the character, but iteration is key:

- Go back and forward between sculpting, adjusting topology, and tweaking weights until the clothing looks right and deforms well in various poses.
- If something is off compared to the concept art (maybe the AI misunderstood a part of the design), you might have to model that part manually. It’s common to model small accessories or intricate pieces separately (for example, a belt buckle or a brooch) and then attach them.
- **LOD (Level of Detail):** If this is for a game, consider making lower-poly versions or at least ensure the topology is efficient. AI meshes can be decimated or re-generated at lower detail if needed.

**8. Final Check and Export:** Once satisfied, you can integrate the clothed character into your project. Because we focused on Blender compatibility, you can continue to animate or render in Blender. If exporting to a game engine, export the character with the outfit as FBX/GLTF with the armature. Double-check that all parts are properly bound and that textures are packed or exported.

Throughout this process, remember that **AI is a helper, not a replacement** for your skill. Even the best AI-generated model benefits from a human artist’s eye for clean topology and style accuracy. As one guide noted, AI tools speed up getting a base, but **“as AI is not perfect, [enhancement] is recommended”** to reach production quality ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=enhancement%20process%20to%20improve%20textures,product%20configurators)). Don’t hesitate to do manual touch-ups – the goal is a high-quality anime-style outfit that looks like it was hand-crafted for the character.

## Conclusion

Converting 2D anime-style clothing into 3D is becoming more accessible thanks to AI innovations. Tools like Meshy, PicTo3D, and others can **generate a quick 3D draft** of an outfit from a single concept image ([Top AI Tools for Model Generation on Blender 3D - Vagon](https://vagon.io/blog/top-ai-tools-for-model-generation-on-blender-3d#:~:text=Pic%20To%203D%20Mesh%20is,customization%20of%20the%20generated%20models)) ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=Behind%20this%20technology%20lies%20computer,precision%20by%20employing%20multiple%20perspectives)), saving hours of initial modeling. However, the **best results come from a hybrid workflow**: leveraging AI for speed and then applying traditional modeling techniques for accuracy and clean topology. This collaborative approach (AI plus human) is highlighted as the future of 3D content creation ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=Step,a%203D%20Model%20with%20AI)) ([Converting 2D Images into 3D Models with AI: The step-by-step Guide](https://mazingxr.com/en/2d-images-to-3d-models-with-ai/#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Enhance%20the%20Model,with%20Designers)) – AI handles the heavy lifting of shape prediction, while the artist refines and stylizes the final asset.

By carefully choosing the right tools and following a structured workflow, you can efficiently bring 2D costume designs into the 3D world, ready to be worn by your Blender character. The combination of AI-assisted generation and manual refinement ensures you get both **speed and quality** – detailed Genshin Impact-style clothing that not only looks great but is also rigged and optimized for your creative projects.
