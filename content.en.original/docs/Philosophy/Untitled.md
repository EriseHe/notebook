### Can you imagine sexuality without gender?

For Foucault

Sexual identity i s produced within the grid of sexuality
- from normal to abnormal
- changes over time

	Modern subject is a sexual subject (gendered being)

What does freedom look like in this?
When there is no *outside*, what does it mean to have transgression?
