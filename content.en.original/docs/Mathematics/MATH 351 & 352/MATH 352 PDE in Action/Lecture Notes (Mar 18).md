## Section 9.3: Wave Equation

### PDE:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + a\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0
$$

### Domain & Initial Conditions:
- $x \in \mathbb{R}, \quad t > 0$  
- Initial condition:  
$$
u(x, 0) = u_0(x)
$$

### Characteristics Method:
- Characteristic curves defined by:  
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = a,\quad x(0) = x_0 \implies x = at + x_0
$$

- Along characteristics:  
$$
\frac{du}{dt} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + a \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0
$$

Thus, $u$ remains constant along these lines.

### Solution form:
$$
u(x, t) = u_0(x - at)
$$

## PDE Discretization & Matrix Formulation

Given PDEs:

$$
x - \mu'' = f
$$

$$
-\mu u'' + \beta u = f
$$

### Discretized Form (Finite Differences):
$$
-\mu \frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{\kappa}{T} u_i = f_i
$$

### Matrix Formulation:
$$
\left[ A + \frac{\kappa}{T} I \right] u = f
$$
