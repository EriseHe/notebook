## Criterion for Integrability

**Q:** When is $f$ integrable?

**A:** $f$ is integrable when the set of discontinuity is *small*.

### 1. How to measure the size of $A$

- Volume of $A$

> [!definition]
>  A bounded set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has *volume* (or is Jordan measurable) if its characteristic function:
> $$1_A(x) = 
\begin{cases}
1, & x \in A \\
0, & x \notin A
\end{cases} $$ 
is integrable:

$$V(A) = \int_A 1_A(x)\, dx$$

**Fact:** $V(A) = 0 \iff \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists$ finite cover of $A$ by rectangles $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_N$ such that:

$$\sum_{i=1}^N V(S_i) < \varepsilon$$

> [!definition]
> A set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ *(not necessarily bounded)* has measure zero, written as $m(A) = 0$, if $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, there exists a countable cover of $A$ by rectangles $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ such that:
> $$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} V(S_i) < \varepsilon$$

### 2. Properties of measure zero sets

**Facts:**
- $V(A) = 0 \implies m(A) = 0$
- $A$ is finite $\implies V(A) = 0$
- $A$ is countable $\implies m(A) = 0$

> [!theorem|8.2.4]
>  Suppose $A_i \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (for $i = 1, 2, \dots$) with $m(A_i) = 0$ for all $i = 1, 2, \dots$. Then,
>  $$A = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i \text{ has measure zero.}$$

### Proof:
Given $\varepsilon > 0$, for each $i = 1, 2, \dots$, since $m(A_i) = 0$, there exist rectangles $\{S_j^{(i)}\}_{j=1}^{\infty}$ such that

$$
A_i \subset \bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty} S_j^{(i)}, \quad \text{with} \quad \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} V(S_j^{(i)}) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2^i}
$$

Then, the set of rectangles $\{S_j^{(i)}\}_{i,j=1}^{\infty}$ forms a countable collection of rectangles with

$$A = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty} S_j^{(i)}$$

Thus,
$$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} V(S_j^{(i)}) < \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{\varepsilon}{2^i} = \varepsilon$$
Therefore, $m(A) = 0$.

### Remarks:

- **Remark:** This result is *not true for volume zero sets*.
  - **Counterexample:** Rational numbers in $[0,1]$.

- **Remark:** In Definition 2, one can replace closed rectangles $S_i$ by *open* rectangles.

### 3. Lebesgue's Theorem

#### (a) Main Theorem

> [!theorem|8.3.1]
>  Let $A$ be a bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f$ be a bounded function on $A$. Extend $f$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ by letting:
>  $$f(x) = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad x \notin A$$
>  Then $f$ is integrable on $A$ if and only if **the points on which the extended function $f$ is discontinuous form a set of measure zero**.
>  $$D = \text{Set of discontinuity of extended } f$$

---

#### (b) Examples

##### **Example 1**
$$A = [0, 1], \quad f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  1, & x \text{ rational}\$$6pt]
  0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Then, the set of discontinuity points is $D = [0,1]$, and:
$$m(D) \neq 0$$

By Lebesgue's theorem, $f$ is **not integrable**.

##### **Example 2**
$$A = \{\text{rationals in }[0,1]\}, \quad \text{Define } f: A \to \mathbb{R} \text{ by } f(x) \equiv 1$$

Then $f$ is continuous on $A$.

However, the extended $f$ has discontinuity at $[0,1]$.

Thus, $f$ is **NOT** integrable by Lebesgue's theorem.

##### **Example 2**
$$A = \{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 < 1\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$$

$$f(x,y) = 
\begin{cases}
x^2 + \sin\left(\frac{1}{y}\right), & y \neq 0 \\[6pt]
x^2, & y = 0
\end{cases}$$

### **(c) Corollaries**

**Corollary 1**  
A bounded set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has volume **if and only if** the boundary of $A$ has measure zero.

**Proof:**  
Assume $V(A)$ (volume of $A$) exists. Then the indicator function $1_A(x)$ is integrable.  
The set of discontinuities for extended $f$:
$$D = \partial A \quad (\text{boundary of } A)$$

Thus,
$$f = 1_A(x) \text{ is integrable } \Longleftrightarrow m(\partial A) = 0$$
